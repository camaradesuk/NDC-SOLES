"Effects of high dietary sodium chloride content on performance and sodium and potassium balance in growing pigs",NA,NA,NA,"Thirty castrated male Moo Lath pigs (6-8 weeks of age) were used in a 15-week growth trial to study the effect of high dietary sodium chloride (NaCl) content on feed and water intake performance sodium (Na) and potassium (K) balance and plasma aldosterone concentration. The pigs were randomly allocated (ten per treatment) to diets containing 0.24 % Na (Na0.24) 0.28 % Na (Na0.28) and 0.32 % Na (Na0.32) per kg diet. Feed and water was provided ad libitum and water consumption feed offered and feed residues were recorded daily. Every third week the pigs were weighed blood samples were collected and a 3-day total collection of urine and feces was performed. Water intake was higher (P = 0.001) in pigs fed with diets Na0.28 (3.7 L/day) and Na0.32 (3.9 L/day) than in pigs fed with diet Na0.24 (3.4 L/day) and dry matter (DM) intake was higher on diet Na0.32 (P = 0.041) than on the other diets. The average daily body weight (BW) gain was higher on diet Na0.32 than on the other diets (P = 0.031). The feed conversion ratio (in kilogram feed DM to kilogram BW gain) was 4.6 4.6 and 4.1 on treatments Na0.24 Na0.28 and Na0.32 respectively (P = 0.14). The highest Na balance was observed on diet Na0.32 followed by diets Na0.28 and Na0.24 (P < 0.001) while there was no treatment-related pattern for the K balance. The Na/K ratio in feces and urine increased (P < 0.001) and the K/Na ratio in feces (P < 0.001) decreased with increasing Na content in the diet. Plasma aldosterone concentration decreased (P < 0.001) with increasing dietary content of Na. These results indicate that high NaCl intake and free access to water will increase Na balance but do not negatively influence feed intake and performance of growing local pigs.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-23456787"
"insomniac links the development and function of a sleep-regulatory circuit",NA,NA,NA,"Although many genes are known to influence sleep when and how they impact sleep-regulatory circuits remain ill-defined. Here we show that insomniac (inc) a conserved adaptor for the autism-associated Cul3 ubiquitin ligase acts in a restricted period of neuronal development to impact sleep in adult Drosophila. The loss of inc causes structural and functional alterations within the mushroom body (MB) a center for sensory integration associative learning and sleep regulation. In inc mutants MB neurons are produced in excess develop anatomical defects that impede circuit assembly and are unable to promote sleep when activated in adulthood. Our findings link neurogenesis and postmitotic development of sleep-regulatory neurons to their adult function and suggest that developmental perturbations of circuits that couple sensory inputs and sleep may underlie sleep dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-34908527"
"ASD-relevant Animal Models of the Foxp Family of Transcription Factors",NA,NA,NA,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a multifaceted association between genes and the environment. Currently in the majority of patients the etiology of autism is not known and coupled with increasing prevalence rates along with the high degree of heritability of autism the development of animal models is crucial for studying and developing therapies for autism. A key characteristic of autism is marked abnormalities in the acquisition and use of language. Thus to understand and ultimately treat autism is an especially difficult task because no animal produces language as it is defined in humans. In this review we will discuss the FOXP family of genes which are a group of transcription factors that have been linked to both autism as well as language in humans. Due to the association of language/communication and the Foxp family of transcription factors animal models with targeted disruptions of Foxp functioning are powerful tools for understanding the developmental signaling pathways that may be vulnerable in autism.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-24358452"
"DSCAM and DSCAML1 regulate the radial migration and callosal projection in developing cerebral cortex",NA,NA,NA,"Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) is essential for self-avoidance and tiling of dendritic development in sensory neurons in Drosophila. Recent studies also show that DSCAM together with its closely related protein DSCAML1 functions in dendritic self-avoidance of a certain types of interneuron in mammalian retina. However the functions of these DSCAMs in developing mammalian cerebral cortex are not well understood. Here we reduced the expression of DSCAM or DSCAML1 in mouse cortical neurons by RNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. We found that knockdown of DSCAM or DSCAML1 increases the complexity of proximal dendritic branching and impedes the axon growth in cultured neurons. In vivo knockdown experiments showed that both DSCAM and DSCAML1 contribute to normal radial migration and callosal projection during the postnatal development. Our results indicate an important role of DSCAM and DSCAML1 in the development of cortical neural network.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-25451118"
"Behavioral Characterization of MeCP2 Dysfunction-Associated Rett Syndrome and Neuropsychiatric Disorders",NA,NA,NA,"The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene has been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia and most notably Rett syndrome (RTT). Mouse models of MeCP2 dysfunction that have been developed are thus important not only for examining the protein's contribution to RTT but also for elucidating the etiologies of other MECP2-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. In this chapter we present protocols for three behavioral assays for characterizing major functional domains of MeCP2 dysfunction-the open field test for measuring general locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior the three-chambered Crawley box test for assessing social preference and social novelty and the rotarod assay for testing locomotor coordination. It is hoped that these information facilitate systematic characterization of mouse models that may aid in elucidating the role of MeCP2 in neurological disorders as well as assessing the effects of putative mechanistic and therapeutic interventions.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-31273723"
"GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors regulate AMPA receptor traffic through anchoring of the synaptic proteasome",NA,NA,NA,"NMDA receptors play a central role in shaping the strength of synaptic connections throughout development and in mediating synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie some forms of learning and memory formation in the CNS. In the hippocampus and the neocortex, GluN1 is combined primarily with GluN2A and GluN2B, which are differentially expressed during development and confer distinct molecular and physiological properties to NMDA receptors. The contribution of each subunit to the synaptic traffic of NMDA receptors and therefore to their role during development and in synaptic plasticity is still controversial. We report a critical role for the GluN2B subunit in regulating NMDA receptor synaptic targeting. In the absence of GluN2B, the synaptic levels of AMPA receptors are increased and accompanied by decreased constitutive endocytosis of GluA1-AMPA receptor. We used quantitative proteomic analysis to identify changes in the composition of postsynaptic densities from GluN2B_/_ mouse primary neuronal cultures and found altered levels of several ubiquitin proteasome system components, in particular decreased levels of proteasome subunits. Enhancing the proteasome activity with a novel proteasome activator restored the synaptic levels of AMPA receptors in GluN2B_/_ neurons and their endocytosis, revealing that GluN2B-mediated anchoring of the synaptic proteasome is responsible for fine tuning AMPA receptor synaptic levels under basal conditions.

"Organelle and cellular abnormalities associated with hippocampal heterotopia in neonatal doublecortin knockout mice",NA,NA,NA,"Heterotopic or aberrantly positioned cortical neurons are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Various mouse models exist with forms of heterotopia but the composition and state of cells developing in heterotopic bands has been little studied. Dcx knockout (KO) mice show hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell lamination abnormalities appearing from the age of E17.5 and mice suffer from spontaneous epilepsy. The Dcx KO CA3 region is organized in two distinct pyramidal cell layers resembling a heterotopic situation and exhibits hyperexcitability. Here we characterized the abnormally organized cells in postnatal mouse brains. Electron microscopy confirmed that the Dcx KO CA3 layers at postnatal day (P) 0 are distinct and separated by an intermediate layer devoid of neuronal somata. We found that organization and cytoplasm content of pyramidal neurons in each layer were altered compared to wild type (WT) cells. Less regular nuclei and differences in mitochondria and Golgi apparatuses were identified. Each Dcx KO CA3 layer at P0 contained pyramidal neurons but also other closely apposed cells displaying different morphologies. Quantitative PCR and immunodetections revealed increased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and interneurons in close proximity to Dcx KO pyramidal cells. Immunohistochemistry experiments also showed that caspase-3 dependent cell death was increased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of Dcx KO hippocampi at P2. Thus unsuspected ultrastructural abnormalities and cellular heterogeneity may lead to abnormal neuronal function and survival in this model which together may contribute to the development of hyperexcitability.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-24023755"
"Astrocytic Ephrin-B1 Controls Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance in Developing Hippocampus",NA,NA,NA,"Astrocytes are implicated in synapse formation and elimination which are associated with developmental refinements of neuronal circuits. Astrocyte dysfunctions are also linked to synapse pathologies associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Although several astrocyte-derived secreted factors are implicated in synaptogenesis the role of contact-mediated glial-neuronal interactions in synapse formation and elimination during development is still unknown. In this study we examined whether the loss or overexpression of the membrane-bound ephrin-B1 in astrocytes during postnatal day (P) 14-28 period would affect synapse formation and maturation in the developing hippocampus. We found enhanced excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 KO male mice which coincided with a greater vGlut1/PSD95 colocalization higher dendritic spine density and enhanced evoked AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs. In contrast EPSCs were reduced in CA1 neurons neighboring ephrin-B1-overexpressing astrocytes. Overexpression of ephrin-B1 in astrocytes during P14-28 developmental period also facilitated evoked IPSCs in CA1 neurons while evoked IPSCs and miniature IPSC amplitude were reduced following astrocytic ephrin-B1 loss. Lower numbers of parvalbumin-expressing cells and a reduction in the inhibitory VGAT/gephyrin-positive synaptic sites on CA1 neurons in the stratum pyramidale and stratum oriens layers of KO hippocampus may contribute to reduced inhibition and higher excitation. Finally dysregulation of excitatory/inhibitory balance in KO male mice is most likely responsible for impaired sociability observed in these mice. The ability of astrocytic ephrin-B1 to influence both excitatory and inhibitory synapses during development can potentially contribute to developmental refinement of neuronal circuits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This report establishes a link between astrocytes and the development of excitatory and inhibitory balance in the mouse hippocampus during early postnatal development. We provide new evidence that astrocytic ephrin-B1 differentially regulates development of excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus during early postnatal development using a multidisciplinary approach. The ability of astrocytic ephrin-B1 to influence both excitatory and inhibitory synapses during development can potentially contribute to developmental refinement of neuronal circuits and associated behaviors. Given widespread and growing interest in the astrocyte-mediated mechanisms that regulate synapse development and the role of EphB receptors in neurodevelopmental disorders these findings establish a foundation for future studies of astrocytes in clinically relevant conditions.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-32801156"
"ubtor Mutation Causes Motor Hyperactivity by Activating mTOR Signaling in Zebrafish",NA,NA,NA,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling governs important physiological and pathological processes key to cellular life. Loss of mTOR negative regulators and subsequent over-activation of mTOR signaling are major causes underlying epileptic encephalopathy. Our previous studies showed that UBTOR/KIAA1024/MINAR1 acts as a negative regulator of mTOR signaling but whether UBTOR plays a role in neurological diseases remains largely unknown. We therefore examined a zebrafish model and found that ubtor disruption caused increased spontaneous embryonic movement and neuronal activity in spinal interneurons as well as the expected hyperactivation of mTOR signaling in early zebrafish embryos. In addition mutant ubtor larvae showed increased sensitivity to the convulsant pentylenetetrazol and both the motor activity and the neuronal activity were up-regulated. These phenotypic abnormalities in zebrafish embryos and larvae were rescued by treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Taken together our findings show that ubtor regulates motor hyperactivity and epilepsy-like behaviors by elevating neuronal activity and activating mTOR signaling.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-34309811"
"PAC1R Genotype to Phenotype Correlations in Autism Spectrum Disorder",NA,NA,NA,"Amygdala dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies in mice and humans respectively have linked Pac1r/PAC1R function to social behavior and PTSD-susceptibility. Based on this connection to social and emotional processing and the central role played by the amygdala in ASD we examined a putative role for PAC1R in social deficits in ASD and determined the pattern of gene expression in the developing mouse and human amygdala. We reveal that Pac1r/PAC1R is expressed in both mouse and human amygdala from mid-neurogenesis through early postnatal stages critical time points when altered brain trajectories are hypothesized to unfold in ASD. We further find that parents of autistic children carrying a previously identified PTSD-risk genotype (CC) report greater reciprocal social deficits compared to those carrying the non-risk GC genotype. Additionally by exploring resting-state functional connectivity differences in a subsample of the larger behavioral sample we find higher functional connectivity between the amygdala and right middle temporal gyrus in individuals with the CC risk genotype. Thus using multimodal approaches our data reveal that the amygdala-expressed PAC1R gene may be linked to severity of ASD social phenotype and possible alterations in brain connectivity therefore potentially acting as a modifier of amygdala-related phenotypes.

LAY SUMMARY: In this multimodal study across mouse and human we examined expression patterns of Pac1r/PAC1R a gene implicated in social behavior and further explored whether a previously identified human PTSD-linked mutation in PAC1R can predict brain connectivity and social deficits in ASD. We find that PAC1R is highly expressed in the both the mouse and human amygdala. Furthermore our human data suggest that PAC1R genotype is linked to severity of social deficits and functional amygdala connectivity in ASD.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-30556326"
"Behavioral phenotype of the reeler mutant mouse: effects of RELN gene dosage and social isolation",NA,NA,NA,"Reeler (rl/rl) and reeler/wild-type (+/rl) mice synthesize Reln at subnormal rates as do patients with schizophrenia bipolar disorder and autism thereby forming the basis for a Reln hypothesis for vulnerability to these psychopathologies and justifying attention to the behavioral phenotypes of Reln-deficient mice. Tests of gait emotionality social aggression spatial working memory novel-object detection fear conditioning and sensorimotor reflex modulation revealed the behavioral phenotype of rl/rl but not +/rl mice to be different from that of wild-type (+/+) mice. These results reveal no effect of Reln gene dosage and provide significant challenges to both the Reln and the neurodevelopmental hypotheses of the etiology of major psychopathologies.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-14674845"
"Impaired feedforward inhibition of the thalamocortical projection in epileptic Ca2+ channel mutant mice tottering",NA,NA,NA,"The tottering (tg) mice have a mutation in the CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel alpha(1)2.1 subunit gene. tg mice show not only cerebellar ataxia but also absence epilepsy which begins at approximately 3 weeks of age and persists throughout life. Similarities in EEG and sensitivity to antiepileptic drugs suggest that tg mice are a good model for human absence epilepsy. Although imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activity in the thalamocortical network is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of absence epilepsy the effect of the mutation on thalamocortical synaptic responses remains unknown. Here we showed imbalanced impairment of inhibitory synaptic responses in tg mice using brain slice preparations. Somatosensory thalamocortical projection makes not only monosynaptic glutamatergic connections but also disynaptic GABAergic connections which mediate feedforward inhibition onto layer IV neurons. In tg mice IPSC amplitudes recorded from layer IV pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex in response to thalamic stimulation became disproportionately reduced compared with EPSC amplitudes at later developmental stages (postnatal days 21-30). Similar results were obtained by local stimulation of layer IV pyramidal neurons. However IPSC reduction was not seen in layer V pyramidal neurons of epileptic tg mice or in layer IV pyramidal neurons of younger tg mice before the onset of epilepsy (postnatal days 14-16). These results showed that the feedforward inhibition from the thalamus to layer IV neurons of the somatosensory cortex was severely impaired in tg mice and that the impairment of the inhibitory synaptic transmission was correlated to the onset of absence epilepsy.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-16540584"
"Prenatal and early-life exposure to high-level diesel exhaust particles leads to increased locomotor activity and repetitive behaviors in mice",NA,NA,NA,"Abundant evidence indicates that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However limited knowledge is available concerning these contributing factors. An epidemiology study reported a link between increased incidence of autism and living closely to major highways suggesting a possible role for pollutants from highway traffic. We investigated whether maternal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) negatively affects fetal development leading to autism-like phenotype in mice. Female mice and their offspring were exposed to DEP during pregnancy and nursing. Adult male offspring were then tested for behaviors reflecting the typical symptoms of ASD patients. Compared to control mice DEP-exposed offspring exhibited higher locomotor activity elevated levels of self-grooming in the presence of an unfamiliar mouse and increased rearing behaviors which may be relevant to the restricted and repetitive behaviors seen in ASD patients. However the DEP-exposed mice did not exhibit deficits in social interactions or social communication which are the key features of ASD. These results suggest that early life exposure to DEP could have an impact on mouse development leading to observable changes in animal behaviors. Further studies are needed to reveal other environmental insults and genetic factors that would lead to animal models expressing key phenotypes of the autism spectrum disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-23495194"
"Early serotonergic projections to Cajal-Retzius cells: relevance for cortical development",NA,NA,NA,"Although the serotonergic system plays an important role in various neurological disorders the role of early serotonergic projections to the developing cerebral cortex is not well understood. Because serotonergic fibers enter the marginal zone (MZ) before birth it has been suggested that they may influence cortical development through synaptic contacts with Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells. We used immunohistochemistry combined with confocal and electron microscopy to show that the earliest serotonergic projections to the MZ form synaptic contacts with the somata and proximal dendrites of CR cells as early as embryonic day 17. To elucidate the functional significance of these early serotonergic contacts with CR cells we perturbed their normal development by injecting pregnant mice with 5-methoxytryptamine. Lower reelin levels were detected in the brains of newborn pups from the exposed animals. Because reelin plays an important role in the cortical laminar and columnar organization during development we killed some pups from the same litters on postnatal day 7 and analyzed their presubicular cortex. We found that the supragranular layers of the presubicular cortex (which normally display a visible columnar deployment of neurons) were altered in the treated animals. Our results suggest a mechanism of how serotonergic abnormalities during cortical development may disturb the normal cortical organization; and therefore may be relevant for understanding neurological disorders in which abnormalities of the serotonergic system are accompanied by cortical pathology (such as autism).",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-14973240"
"The E-protein Tcf4 interacts with Math1 to regulate differentiation of a specific subset of neuronal progenitors",NA,NA,NA,"Proneural factors represent <10 transcriptional regulators required for specifying all of the different neurons of the mammalian nervous system. The mechanisms by which such a small number of factors creates this diversity are still unknown. We propose that proteins interacting with proneural factors confer such specificity. To test this hypothesis we isolated proteins that interact with Math1 a proneural transcription factor essential for the establishment of a neural progenitor population (rhombic lip) that gives rise to multiple hindbrain structures and identified the E-protein Tcf4. Interestingly haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes the Pitt-Hopkins mental retardation syndrome underscoring the important role for this protein in neural development. To investigate the functional relevance of the Math1/Tcf4 interaction in vivo we studied Tcf4(-/-) mice and found that they have disrupted pontine nucleus development. Surprisingly this selective deficit occurs without affecting other rhombic lip-derived nuclei despite expression of Math1 and Tcf4 throughout the rhombic lip. Importantly deletion of any of the other E-protein-encoding genes does not have detectable effects on Math1-dependent neurons suggesting a specialized role for Tcf4 in distinct neural progenitors. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence for an exclusive function of dimers formed between a proneural basic helix-loop-helix factor and a specific E-protein offering insight about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional programs that regulate development of the mammalian nervous system.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-17878293"
"Effect of agomelatine on memory deficits and hippocampal gene expression induced by chronic social defeat stress in mice",NA,NA,NA,"Chronic stress is known to induce not only anxiety and depressive-like phenotypes in mice but also cognitive impairments for which the action of classical antidepressant compounds remains unsatisfactory. In this context we investigated the effects of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) on anxiety- social- and cognitive-related behaviors as well as hippocampal Bdnf synaptic plasticity markers (PSD-95 Synaptophysin Spinophilin Synapsin I and MAP-2) and epigenetic modifying enzymes (MYST2 HDAC2 HDAC6 MLL3 KDM5B DNMT3B GADD45B) gene expression in C57BL/6J mice. CSDS for 10 days provoked long-lasting anxious-like phenotype in the open field and episodic memory deficits in the novel object recognition test. While total Bdnf mRNA level was unchanged Bdnf exon IV MAP-2 HDAC2 HDAC6 and MLL3 gene expression was significantly decreased in the CSDS mouse hippocampus. In CSDS mice treated 3 weeks with 50âmg/kg/d agomelatine an antidepressant with melatonergic receptor agonist and 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist properties the anxious-like phenotype was not reversed but the treatment successfully prevented the cognitive impairments and hippocampal gene expression modifications. Altogether these data evidenced that in mice agomelatine was effective in alleviating stress-induced altered cognitive functions possibly through a mechanism involving BDNF signaling synaptic plasticity and epigenetic remodeling.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-28374847"
"Proximity labeling identifies a repertoire of site-specific R-loop modulators",NA,NA,NA,"R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that accumulate on chromatin in neurological diseases and cancers and contribute to genome instability. Using a proximity-dependent labeling system we identified distinct classes of proteins that regulate R-loops in vivo through different mechanisms. We show that ATRX suppresses R-loops by interacting with RNAs and preventing R-loop formation. Our proteomics screen also discovered an unexpected enrichment for proteins containing zinc fingers and homeodomains. One of the most consistently enriched proteins was activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) which is frequently mutated in ASD and causal in ADNP syndrome. We find that ADNP resolves R-loops in vitro and that it is necessary to suppress R-loops in vivo at its genomic targets. Furthermore deletion of the ADNP homeodomain severely diminishes R-loop resolution activity in vitro results in R-loop accumulation at ADNP targets and compromises neuronal differentiation. Notably patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells that contain an ADNP syndrome-causing mutation exhibit R-loop and CTCF accumulation at ADNP targets. Our findings point to a specific role for ADNP-mediated R-loop resolution in physiological and pathological neuronal function and more broadly to a role for zinc finger and homeodomain proteins in R-loop regulation with important implications for developmental disorders and cancers.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-35013239"
"Potentiating Î±(2) subunit containing perisomatic GABA(A) receptors protects against seizures in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome",NA,NA,NA,"KEY POINTS: Dravet syndrome mice (Scn1a(+/-) ) demonstrate a marked strain dependence for the severity of seizures which is correlated with GABA(A) receptor Î±(2) subunit expression. The Î±(2) /Î±(3) subunit selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) AZD7325 potentiates inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) specifically in perisomatic synapses. AZD7325 demonstrates stronger effects on IPSCs in the seizure resistant mouse strain consistent with higher Î±(2) subunit expression. AZD7325 demonstrates seizure protective effects in Scn1a(+/-) mice without apparent sedative effects in vivo. ABSTRACT: GABA(A) receptor potentiators are commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy but it is not clear whether targeting distinct GABA(A) receptor subtypes will have disproportionate benefits over adverse effects. Here we demonstrate that the Î±(2) /Î±(3) selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) AZD7325 preferentially potentiates hippocampal inhibitory responses at synapses proximal to the soma of CA1 neurons. The effect of AZD7325 on synaptic responses was more prominent in mice on the 129S6/SvEvTac background strain which have been demonstrated to be seizure resistant in the model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a(+/-) ) and in which the Î±(2) GABA(A) receptor subunits are expressed at higher levels relative to in the seizure prone C57BL/6J background strain. Consistent with this treatment of Scn1a(+/-) mice with AZD7325 elevated the temperature threshold for hyperthermia-induced seizures without apparent sedative effects. Our results in a model system indicate that selectively targeting Î±(2) is a potential therapeutic option for Dravet syndrome.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-31045243"
"Different attentional abilities among inbred mice strains using virtual object recognition task (VORT): SNAP25âº/â» mice as a model of attentional deficit",NA,NA,NA,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) schizophrenia Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are characterized by attentional deficits. In the present study we first applied the virtual object recognition test (VORT) where 3D objects were replaced with highly discriminated geometrical shapes and presented on two 3.5-inch widescreen displays in different inbred mice strains (C57BL/6N DBA/2J BALB/cJ) in comparison with the standard object recognition test (NOR). In both NOR and VORT there was a progressive decay of performance in terms of reduced discrimination index from 5 min to 72 h of inter-trial delay in all strains. However BALB/cJ inbred mice showed a better long lasting performance than C57BL/6N and DBA/2J when tested in NOR. In VORT BALB/cJ showed the best performance. Total exploration time was always higher in BALB/cJ than C57BL/6N and DBA/2J mice. C57BL/6N were less explorative strain than DBA/2J and BALB/cJ mice. When VORT was applied to SNAP-25(+/-) mice an impairment in both NOR and VORT was shown. However when moving shapes were applied these heterozygous mice improved their performance suggesting that the introduction of motion is a strong cue that makes the task more valuable to study attention deficits. Taken together these data indicate that VORT provides a useful and rapid tool to identify the attentional deficit in different inbred strains and genetically modified mice enhancing the value of psychiatric mouse models.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-26300453"
"POGZ Is Required for Silencing Mouse Embryonic Î²-like Hemoglobin and Human Fetal Hemoglobin Expression",NA,NA,NA,"Fetal globin genes are transcriptionally silenced during embryogenesis through hemoglobin switching.

POGZ binds to the Bcl11a promoter and erythroid-specific intragenic regulatory regions.

"Blocking histamine H(1) improves learning and mnemonic dysfunction in mice with social isolation plus repeated methamphetamine injection",NA,NA,NA,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of histamine H(1) and H(3) antagonists on learning and mnemonic dysfunction in mice. Two H(1) antagonists pyrilamine and clozapine and the prototypic H(3) antagonist thioperamide were used to study the role of histamine in mice with social isolation and repeated methamphetamine administration. Mice with social isolation and repeated methamphetamine administration showed significant disruption of prepulse inhibition as compared to both the socially-housed mice and isolation-housing mice. Furthermore social isolation and repeated methamphetamine administration caused significant learning and mnemonic dysfunctions. Treatment with clozapine improved learning and mnemonic ability in all of the tasks. Pyrilamine treatment ameliorated performance in all the tests examined except for the passive avoidance test. Thioperamide however did not change the learning and mnemonic ability. Donepezil an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor reversed the learning and mnemonic dysfunction in all four tasks.

"The microbiota promotes social behavior by modulating microglial remodeling of forebrain neurons",NA,NA,NA,"Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota microglial remodeling of neural circuits and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor c1q. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-36318534"
"Genetic background controls tumor development in PTEN-deficient mice",NA,NA,NA,"PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. Germ line mutations of PTEN have been detected in three rare autosomal-dominant disorders. However identical mutations in the PTEN gene may lead to different symptoms that have traditionally been described as different disorders such as Cowden disease Lhermitte-Duclos disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndromes. This lack of genotype-phenotype correlation prompted us to directly test the possible effects of genetic background or modifier genes on PTEN-controlled tumorigenesis using genetically engineered mouse models. In this study we generated two animal models in which either exon 5 (Pten(Delta5)) or promoter to exon 3 (Pten(-)) of the murine Pten gene were deleted and compared phenotypes associated with individual mutations on two genetic backgrounds. We found that the onset and spectrum of tumor formation depend significantly on the genetic background but less on the type of mutation generated.

To systemically dissect molecular effects we performed transcriptome profiling of 350 libraries from six tissues (cortex cerebellum striatum liver brown fat and white fat) in mouse models harboring CNVs of the syntenic 7qF3 region as well as cellular transcriptional and single-cell analyses in 54 isogenic neural stem cell induced neuron and cerebral organoid models of CRISPR-engineered 16p11.2 CNVs. Transcriptome-wide differentially expressed genes were largely tissue- cell-type- and dosage-specific although more effects were shared between deletion and duplication and across tissue than expected by chance. The broadest effects were observed in the cerebellum (2163 differentially expressed genes) and the greatest enrichments were associated with synaptic pathways in mouse cerebellum and human induced neurons. Pathway and co-expression analyses identified energy and RNA metabolism as shared processes and enrichment for ASD-associated loss-of-function constraint and fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein target gene sets. Intriguingly reciprocal 16p11.2 dosage changes resulted in consistent decrements in neurite and electrophysiological features and single-cell profiling of organoids showed reciprocal alterations to the proportions of excitatory and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Changes both in neuronal ratios and in gene expression in our organoid analyses point most directly to calretinin GABAergic inhibitory neurons and the excitatory/inhibitory balance as targets of disruption that might contribute to changes in neurodevelopmental and cognitive function in 16p11.2 carriers. Collectively our data indicate the genomic disorder involves disruption of multiple contributing biological processes and that this disruption has relative impacts that are context specific.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-36152629"
"DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development",NA,NA,NA,"The establishment of DNA methylation patterns requires de novo methylation that occurs predominantly during early development and gametogenesis in mice. Here we demonstrate that two recently identified DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and for mouse development. Inactivation of both genes by gene targeting blocks de novo methylation in ES cells and early embryos but it has no effect on maintenance of imprinted methylation patterns. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b also exhibit nonoverlapping functions in development with Dnmt3b specifically required for methylation of centromeric minor satellite repeats. Mutations of human DNMT3B are found in ICF syndrome a developmental defect characterized by hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats.

"Impaired autophagy in neurons after disinhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin and its contribution to epileptogenesis",NA,NA,NA,"Certain mutations within the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway most notably those affecting the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and result in a high incidence of epilepsy in humans and animal models. Although hyperactivation of mTOR has been strongly linked to the development of epilepsy and conversely inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin treatment is protective against seizures in several models the downstream epileptic mechanisms have remained elusive. Autophagy a catabolic process that plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis by mediating the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents is negatively regulated by mTOR. Here we demonstrate that autophagy is suppressed in brain tissues of forebrain-specific conditional TSC1 and phosphatase and tensin homlog knock-out mice both of which display aberrant mTOR activation and seizures. In addition we also discovered that autophagy is suppressed in the brains of human TSC patients. Moreover conditional deletion of Atg7 an essential regulator of autophagy in mouse forebrain neurons is sufficient to promote development of spontaneous seizures. Thus our study suggests that impaired autophagy contributes to epileptogenesis which may be of interest as a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy treatment and/or prevention.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-23136410"
"In vivo imaging of mGlu5 receptor expression in humans with Fragile X Syndrome towards development of a potential biomarker",NA,NA,NA,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene. The resulting loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) leads to excessive glutamate signaling via metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors (mGluR5) which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In the present study we used the radioligand 3-[18F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([(18)F]FPEB) in simultaneous PET-MR imaging of males with FXS and age- and gender-matched controls to assess the availability of mGlu5 receptors in relevant brain areas. Patients with FXS showed lower [(18)F]FPEB binding potential (pâ<â 0.01) reflecting reduced mGluR5 availability than the healthy controls throughout the brain with significant group differences in insula anterior cingulate parahippocampal inferior temporal and olfactory cortices regions associated with deficits in inhibition memory and visuospatial processes characteristic of the disorder. The results are among the first to provide in vivo evidence of decreased availability of mGluR5 in the brain in individuals with FXS than in healthy controls.

"A pathogenetic model of autism involving Purkinje cell loss through anti-GAD antibodies",NA,NA,NA,"Autism is a medical enigma lacking truly effective treatments. Both genetics and environmental factors are recognized as players in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Nevertheless the exact mechanism(s) for the development of ASDs is (are) not known primarily because current understanding about the etiology of the disease is limited. Selective loss of Purkinje cells and the cerebellar atrophies are the neurological abnormalities most consistently found in persons diagnosed with autism. Because Purkinje cells are involved in motor coordination working memory and learning loss of these cells are likely to cause symptoms defining behavioral parameters of ASD. Currently the mechanism(s) for the loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebella of autistic individual is (are) not understood. Here we postulate a hypothesis for the development of autistic symptoms severity of which is based on the extent of Purkinje cell loss triggered by Glutamate acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab). This model accommodates any genetic basis of autism and immunogenic triggers resulting GAD-Ab in the blood of the mother while pregnant with the child diagnosed autistic after birth or of an individual diagnosed with autism some time in the life time.

"An autism spectrum disorder-related de novo mutation hotspot discovered in the GEF1 domain of Trio",NA,NA,NA,"The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Trio promotes actin polymerization by directly activating the small GTPase Rac1. Recent studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related behavioral phenotypes in animal models of ASD can be produced by dysregulation of Rac1's control of actin polymerization at glutamatergic synapses. Here in humans we discover a large cluster of ASD-related de novo mutations in Trio's Rac1 activating domain GEF1. Our study reveals that these mutations produce either hypofunctional or hyperfunctional forms of Trio in rodent neurons in vitro. In accordance with pathological increases or decreases in glutamatergic neurotransmission observed in animal models of ASD we find that these mutations result in either reduced synaptic AMPA receptor expression or enhanced glutamatergic synaptogenesis. Together our findings implicate both excessive and reduced Trio activity and the resulting synaptic dysfunction in ASD-related pathogenesis and point to the Trio-Rac1 pathway at glutamatergic synapses as a possible key point of convergence of many ASD-related genes.Trio is a RhoGEF protein that promotes actin polymerization and is implicated in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Visual phenotype in Williams-Beuren syndrome challenges magnocellular theories explaining human neurodevelopmental visual cortical disorders",NA,NA,NA,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder whose manifestations include visuospatial impairment provides a unique model to link genetically determined loss of neural cell populations at different levels of the nervous system with neural circuits and visual behavior. Given that several of the genes deleted in WBS are also involved in eye development and the differentiation of retinal layers we examined the retinal phenotype in WBS patients and its functional relation to global motion perception. We discovered a low-level visual phenotype characterized by decreased retinal thickness abnormal optic disk concavity and impaired visual responses in WBS patients compared with age-matched controls by using electrophysiology confocal and coherence in vivo imaging with cellular resolution and psychophysics. These mechanisms of impairment are related to the magnocellular pathway which is involved in the detection of temporal changes in the visual scene. Low-level magnocellular performance did not predict high-level deficits in the integration of motion and 3D information at higher levels thereby demonstrating independent mechanisms of dysfunction in WBS that will require remediation strategies different from those used in other visuospatial disorders. These findings challenge neurodevelopmental theories that explain cortical deficits based on low-level magnocellular impairment such as regarding dyslexia.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-18037993"
"Developmental regulation of adult cortical morphology and behavior: an animal model for mental retardation",NA,NA,NA,"The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral performance in adult mice which as neonates had received lesions to cortically projecting cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. The nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM) provides the primary cholinergic innervation to cerebral cortex. Lesions in the nBM in neonatal mice result in transient cholinergic denervation and persistent abnormalities in cortical morphology and cytoarchitecture. These cortical abnormalities resemble pathologies observed in a number of developmental disabilities in humans including Down Syndrome. Balb/CByJ mice received lesions to the nBM 12-24 hr after birth; littermates served as controls. Behavioral testing began 8 weeks after the lesion and included assessments of spontaneous motor activity retention (a passive avoidance task) and cognition (the Morris swim task). Following behavioral testing a subset of mice was killed for Nissl and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histology. The cortical morphology in these brains was evaluated and ranked by the experimenter who was blind to the lesion and behavioral studies. The lesioned mice exhibited increased spontaneous activity as compared to littermate controls. The lesioned mice were also severely impaired in performance of the retention and cognitive task; they showed decreased passive avoidance retention latencies and increased swim maze latencies as compared to controls. The brains of all of the lesioned mice exhibited cortical morphological abnormalities that ranged from slight to severe. Cortical AChE intensity and distribution in the brains of the lesioned mice however were comparable to those of controls. In correlation studies of behavioral and morphological data motor activity did not correlate with either passive avoidance retention or swim maze latencies. Additionally cortical cytoarchitectural abnormalities did not correlate with motor activity. Cortical cytoarchitectural abnormalities did however correlate with both passive avoidance and swim maze latencies i.e. severely abnormal cortical morphology predicted low passive avoidance retention latencies and high swim maze latencies. These data indicate that cortical cytoarchitectural abnormalities resulting from nBM lesions in neonates correlate with impairments on the cognitive task but not with the activity measures in adult mice. Thus in this lesion model and by extrapolation in developmental disabilities in humans structural changes in the cortex which result from transient disruption of cortical cholinergic innervation may lead to persistent cognitive impairments in adulthood.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-7976481"

We have discovered a surprising robust sexually dichotomized Adnp genotype effect and correction by NAP (CP201) as follows. Most of the commensal bacterial microbiota tested were affected by the Adnp genotype and corrected by NAP treatment in a male sex-dependent manner. The following list includes all the bacterial groups tested-labeled in bold are male Adnp-genotype increased and corrected (decreased) by NAP.

CC2D1A gene firstly associated with the intellectual disability (ID) in a family with a large deletion. We aimed to contribute to the literature by sequencing this gene and by this way we report novel CC2D1A variations in patients with ASD. METHODS: Forty families who have a child with a diagnosis of ASD were enrolled to the study. DNA samples were obtained from each family member. Bidirectional CC2D1A gene sequencing was performed with CEQ Cycle Sequencing Kit and the products were analyzed on the Beckman CEQ 8000. All of the genetic analysis was conducted in Erciyes University Genome and Stem Cell Center (GENKOK). RESULTS: According to the sequencing results we defined new alterations in this gene with two SNPs in exon 15 and 19 (rs747172992 and rs1364074600) in our patients. We found a pathogenic variant in one patient. This variant was located in the acceptor region. Six of the variants were missense mutations. Additionally six different benign variants were detected in 30 patients; however they were not associated with ASD. Two patients carried multiple rare variants.

Sensory structures of the otic vesicle also showed a marked developmental delay. Pigmentation of the outer layer of the otic cup starts later in trisomic animals. Cleared specimens on day 16 showed retarded development of ossification centres in all areas of the skull. These findings correspond with the abnormal facial morphology found in Down's syndrome and may also provide new insights into the hearing impairment commonly found.

However the molecular events that limit excitatory synapse development so that synapses form at the right time and place and in the correct numbers are less well understood. We have identified a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ephexin5 which negatively regulates excitatory synapse development until EphrinB binding to the EphB receptor tyrosine kinase triggers Ephexin5 phosphorylation ubiquitination and degradation. The degradation of Ephexin5 promotes EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development and is mediated by Ube3A a ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in the human cognitive disorder Angelman syndrome and duplicated in some forms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). These findings suggest that aberrant EphB/Ephexin5 signaling during the development of synapses may contribute to the abnormal cognitive function that occurs in Angelman syndrome and possibly ASDs.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-21029865"
"A novel mouse model that recapitulates adult-onset glycogenosis type 4",NA,NA,NA,"Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the glycogen-branching enzyme (GBE). The diagnostic hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of a poorly branched form of glycogen known as polyglucosan (PG). The disease is clinically heterogeneous, with variable tissue involvement and age at onset. Complete loss of enzyme activity is lethal in utero or in infancy and affects primarily the muscle and the liver. However, residual enzyme activity as lowas 5-20% leads to juvenile or adult onset of a disorder that primarily affects the central and peripheral nervous system and muscles and in the latter is termed adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD). Here, we describe a mouse model of GSD IV that reflects this spectrum of disease. Homologous recombination was used to knock in the most common GBE1 mutation p.Y329S c.986A > C found in APBD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Mice homozygous for this allele (Gbe1ys/ys) exhibit a phenotype similar to APBD, with widespread accumulation of PG. Adult mice exhibit progressive neuromuscular dysfunction and die prematurely. While the onset of symptoms is limited to adult mice, PG accumulates in tissues of newborn mice but is initially absent from the cerebral cortex and heart muscle. Thus, PG is well tolerated in most tissues, but the eventual accumulation in neurons and their axons causes neuropathy that leads to hind limb spasticity and premature death.

"Rapamycin improves sociability in the BTBR T(+)Itpr3(tf)/J mouse model of autism spectrum disorders",NA,NA,NA,"Overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of syndromic forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) such as tuberous sclerosis complex neurofibromatosis 1 and fragile X syndrome. Administration of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) inhibitors (e.g. rapamycin) in syndromic mouse models of ASDs improved behavior cognition and neuropathology. However since only a minority of ASDs are due to the effects of single genes (â¼10%) there is a need to explore inhibition of mTOR activity in mouse models that may be more relevant to the majority of nonsyndromic presentations such as the genetically inbred BTBR T(+)Itpr3(tf)/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASDs. BTBR mice have social impairment and exhibit increased stereotypic behavior. In prior work d-cycloserine a partial glycineB site agonist that targets the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was shown to improve sociability in both Balb/c and BTBR mouse models of ASDs. Importantly NMDA receptor activation regulates mTOR signaling activity. The current study investigated the ability of rapamycin (10mg/kg i.p.Ãfour days) an mTORC1 inhibitor to improve sociability and stereotypic behavior in BTBR mice. Using a standard paradigm to assess mouse social behavior rapamycin improved several measures of sociability in the BTBR mouse suggesting that mTOR overactivation represents a therapeutic target that mediates or contributes to impaired sociability in the BTBR mouse model of ASDs.

"Activity-dependent modulation of synapse-regulating genes in astrocytes",NA,NA,NA,"Astrocytes regulate the formation and function of neuronal synapses via multiple signals; however what controls regional and temporal expression of these signals during development is unknown. We determined the expression profile of astrocyte synapse-regulating genes in the developing mouse visual cortex identifying astrocyte signals that show differential temporal and layer-enriched expression. These patterns are not intrinsic to astrocytes but regulated by visually evoked neuronal activity as they are absent in mice lacking glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals. Consequently synapses remain immature. Expression of synapse-regulating genes and synaptic development is also altered when astrocyte signaling is blunted by diminishing calcium release from astrocyte stores. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified groups of astrocytic genes regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity and a cassette of genes that show layer-specific enrichment. Thus the development of cortical circuits requires coordinated signaling between astrocytes and neurons highlighting astrocytes as a target to manipulate in neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-34494546"

Estimation of the number of genes involved in the development of LMD using Wright's formula showed that at least two to four genes are involved. These results suggest that the inheritance of LMD is polygenically controlled and that there may be a single major gene but this locus is not sex-linked.

"IRSp53 promotes postsynaptic density formation and actin filament bundling",NA,NA,NA,"IRSp53 (aka BAIAP2) is a scaffold protein that couples membranes with the cytoskeleton in actin-filled protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. The protein is abundantly expressed in excitatory synapses and is essential for synapse development and synaptic plasticity although with poorly understood mechanisms. Here we show that specific multivalent interactions between IRSp53 and its binding partners PSD-95 or Shank3 drive phase separation of the complexes in solution. IRSp53 can be enriched to the reconstituted excitatory PSD (ePSD) condensates via bridging to the core and deeper layers of ePSD. Overexpression of a mutant defective in the IRSp53/PSD-95 interaction perturbs synaptic enrichment of IRSp53 in mouse cortical neurons. The reconstituted PSD condensates promote bundled actin filament formation both in solution and on membranes via IRSp53-mediated actin binding and bundling. Overexpression of mutants that perturb IRSp53-actin interaction leads to defects in synaptic maturation of cortical neurons. Together our studies provide potential mechanistic insights into the physiological roles of IRSp53 in synapse formation and function.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-35819332"
"Novel alterations in the epigenetic signature of MeCP2-targeted promoters in lymphocytes of Rett syndrome patients",NA,NA,NA,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with neurological symptoms such as motor disorders and mental retardation.

Transcriptional regulation of neurotrophic factor BDNF and transcription factor DLX5 essential for proper neurogenesis is further altered in MeCP2-deleted animals. We therefore investigated the chromatin environment of MeCP2 target genes BDNF and DLX5 in lymphocytes from RTT patients and human controls and analyzed the density of histones H3 H2B and H1 as well as the levels of methylation and acetylation on selected lysines of histone H3. Notably we found a general increase in the density of histone H3 in RTT patients' lymphocytes compared with controls and decreased levels of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) a modification associated with transcriptional activation. The levels of acetylation of lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and 27 (H3K27ac) did not show any statistically significant changes when normalized to the decreased histone H3 levels; nevertheless an average decrease in acetylation was noted.

"Selective Inactivation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 22 (FGF22) in CA3 Pyramidal Neurons Impairs Local Synaptogenesis and Affective Behavior Without Affecting Dentate Neurogenesis",NA,NA,NA,"Various growth factors regulate synapse development and neurogenesis and are essential for brain function. Changes in growth factor signaling are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression autism and epilepsy. We have previously identified that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is critical for excitatory synapse formation in several brain regions including the hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22 null mice) have fewer excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We have further found that as a behavioral consequence FGF22 null mice show a depression-like behavior phenotype such as increased passive stress-coping behavior and anhedonia without any changes in motor anxiety or social cognitive tests suggesting that FGF22 is specifically important for affective behavior. Thus addressing the precise roles of FGF22 in the brain will help understand how synaptogenic growth factors regulate affective behavior. In the hippocampus FGF22 is expressed mainly by CA3 pyramidal neurons but also by a subset of dentate granule cells. We find that in addition to synapse formation FGF22 also contributes to neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus: FGF22 null mice show decreased dentate neurogenesis. To understand the cell type-specific roles of FGF22 we generated and analyzed CA3-specific FGF22 knockout mice (FGF22-CA3KO). We show that FGF22-CA3KO mice have reduced excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons but do not show changes in dentate neurogenesis. Behaviorally FGF22-CA3KO mice still show increased immobility and decreased latency to float in the forced swim test and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test which are suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype similar to FGF22 null mice. These results demonstrate that: (i) CA3-derived FGF22 serves as a target-derived excitatory synaptic organizer in CA3 in vivo; (ii) FGF22 plays important roles in dentate neurogenesis but CA3-derived FGF22 is not involved in neurogenesis; and (iii) a depression-like phenotype can result from FGF22 inactivation selectively in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Our results link the role of CA3-derived FGF22 in synapse development and not in neurogenesis to affective behavior.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-29311892"

We also describe the clinical phenotypes of two individuals with CIC haploinsufficiency syndrome who have not been reported previously. To help bring biological insights gained from model systems a step closer to disease gene discovery, we discuss tools and resources that will facilitate this process.

Variants in ATP6V0A1 the brain-enriched isoform in the V0 domain have been recently associated with developmental delay and epilepsy in four individuals. Here we identified 17 individuals from 14 unrelated families with both with new and previously characterized variants in this gene representing the largest cohort to date. Five affected subjects with biallelic variants in this gene presented with a phenotype of early-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia while 12 individuals carried de novo missense variants and showed severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The R740Q mutation which alone accounts for almost 50% of the mutations identified among our cases leads to failure of lysosomal hydrolysis by directly impairing acidification of the endolysosomal compartment causing autophagic dysfunction and severe developmental defect in Caenorhabditis elegans.

"Choline Plus Working Memory Training Improves Prenatal Alcohol-Induced Deficits in Cognitive Flexibility and Functional Connectivity in Adulthood in Rats",NA,NA,NA,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is the leading known cause of intellectual disability and may manifest as deficits in cognitive function including working memory. Working memory capacity and accuracy increases during adolescence when neurons in the prefrontal cortex undergo refinement. Rats exposed to low doses of ethanol prenatally show deficits in working memory during adolescence and in cognitive flexibility in young adulthood. The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in learning and memory processes. Here we report that the combination of choline and training on a working memory task during adolescence significantly improved cognitive flexibility (performance on an attentional set shifting task) in young adulthood: 92% of all females and 81% of control males formed an attentional set but only 36% of ethanol-exposed males did. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that functional connectivity among brain regions was different between the sexes and was altered by prenatal ethanol exposure and by choline + training. Connectivity particularly between prefrontal cortex and striatum was also different in males that formed a set compared with those that did not. Together these findings indicate that prenatal exposure to low doses of ethanol has persistent effects on brain functional connectivity and behavior that these effects are sex-dependent and that an adolescent intervention could mitigate some of the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-33202683"

Zebrafish is one of the most social vertebrates used as a model in biomedical research contributing to an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie social behavior. Valproic acid (VPA) is used as an anti-epileptic drug and mood stabilizer; however prenatal VPA exposure in humans has been associated with an increased incidence of autism and it can also affect fetal brain development. Therefore we conducted a behavioral screening at different periods of zebrafish development at 6 30 70 and 120dpf (days postfertilization) after VPA exposure in the early development stage to investigate social behavior locomotion aggression and anxiety. VPA (48Î¼M) exposure during the first 48hpf (hours postfertilization) did not promote changes on survival morphology and hatching rate at 24hpf 48hpf and 72hpf. The behavioral patterns suggest that VPA exposure induces changes in locomotor activity and anxiety at different developmental periods in zebrafish. Furthermore a social interaction deficit is present at 70dpf and 120dpf. VPA exposure did not affect aggression in the adult stage at 70dpf and 120dpf. This is the first study that demonstrated zebrafish exposed to VPA during the first 48h of development exhibit deficits in social interaction anxiety and hyperactivity at different developmental periods.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-26477937"
"Potential involvement of DSCAML1 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders",NA,NA,NA,"The molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remain unclear. We previously identified Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like 1 (Dscaml1) as a responsible gene for Ihara epileptic rat (IER) a rat model for human NDDs with epilepsy. However the relationship between NDDs and DSCAML1 in humans is still elusive. In this study we screened databases of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) intellectual disability (ID)/developmental disorders (DD) and schizophrenia for genomic mutations in human DSCAML1. We then performed in silico analyses to estimate the potential damage to the mutated DSCAML1 proteins and chose three representative mutations (DSCAML1(C729R)  DSCAML1(R1685*) and DSCAML1(K2108Nfs*37) ) which lacked a cysteine residue in the seventh Ig domain the intracellular region and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif respectively. In overexpression experiments in a cell line DSCAML1(C729R) lost its mature N-glycosylation whereas DSCAML1(K2108Nfs*37) was abnormally degraded via proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Furthermore in primary hippocampal neurons the ability of the wild-type DSCAML1 to regulate the number of synapses was lost with all mutant proteins. These results provide insight into understanding the roles of the domains in the DSCAML1 protein and further suggest that these mutations cause functional changes albeit through different mechanisms that likely affect the pathophysiology of NDDs.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-33501714"
"Integrative proteomic analysis of the NMDA NR1 knockdown mouse model reveals effects on central and peripheral pathways associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders",NA,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade the transgenic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR1-knockdown mouse (NR1(neo-/-)) has been investigated as a glutamate hypofunction model for schizophrenia. Recent research has now revealed that the model also recapitulates cognitive and negative symptoms in the continuum of other psychiatric diseases particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). As previous studies have mostly focussed on behavioural readouts a molecular characterisation of this model will help to identify novel biomarkers or potential drug targets. METHODS: Here we have used multiplex immunoassay analyses to investigate peripheral analyte alterations in serum of NR1(neo-/-) mice as well as a combination of shotgun label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry bioinformatic pathway analyses and a shotgun-based 40-plex selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay to investigate altered molecular pathways in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. All findings were cross compared to identify translatable findings between the brain and periphery. RESULTS: Multiplex immunoassay profiling led to identification of 29 analytes that were significantly altered in sera of NR1(neo-/-) mice. The highest magnitude changes were found for neurotrophic factors (VEGFA EGF IGF-1) apolipoprotein A1 and fibrinogen. We also found decreased levels of several chemokines. Following this LC-MS(E) profiling led to identification of 48 significantly changed proteins in the frontal cortex and 41 in the hippocampus. In particular MARCS the mitochondrial pyruvate kinase and CamKII-alpha were affected. Based on the combination of protein set enrichment and bioinformatic pathway analysis we designed orthogonal SRM-assays which validated the abnormalities of proteins involved in synaptic long-term potentiation myelination and the ERK-signalling pathway in both brain regions. In contrast increased levels of proteins involved in neurotransmitter metabolism and release were found only in the frontal cortex and abnormalities of proteins involved in the purinergic system were found exclusively in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together this multi-platform profiling study has identified peripheral changes which are potentially linked to central alterations in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function associated with NMDAR-NR1 hypofunction. Therefore the reported proteomic changes may be useful as translational biomarkers in human and rodent model drug discovery efforts.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-25061506"

"BBSome function is required for both the morphogenesis and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment",NA,NA,NA,"Genetic mutations disrupting the structure and function of primary cilia cause various inherited retinal diseases in humans. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous pleiotropic ciliopathy characterized by retinal degeneration obesity postaxial polydactyly intellectual disability and genital and renal abnormalities. To gain insight into the mechanisms of retinal degeneration in BBS we developed a congenital knockout mouse of Bbs8 as well as conditional mouse models in which function of the BBSome (a protein complex that mediates ciliary trafficking) can be temporally inactivated or restored. We demonstrate that BBS mutant mice have defects in retinal outer segment morphogenesis. We further demonstrate that removal of Bbs8 in adult mice affects photoreceptor function and disrupts the structural integrity of the outer segment. Notably using a mouse model in which a gene trap inhibiting Bbs8 gene expression can be removed by an inducible FLP recombinase we show that when BBS8 is restored in immature retinas with malformed outer segments outer segment extension can resume normally and malformed outer segment discs are displaced distally by normal outer segment structures. Over time the retinas of the rescued mice become morphologically and functionally normal indicating that there is a window of plasticity when initial retinal outer segment morphogenesis defects can be ameliorated.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-29049287"
"Targeted deletion of the murine Lgr4 gene decreases lens epithelial cell resistance to oxidative stress and induces age-related cataract formation",NA,NA,NA,"Oxidative stress contributes to the formation of cataracts. The leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4 also known as GPR48) is important in many developmental processes. Since deletion of Lgr4 has previously been shown to lead to cataract formation in mice we sought to determine the specific role that Lgr4 plays in the formation of cataracts. Initially the lens opacities of Lgr4(-/-) mice at different ages without ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) were evaluated with slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Lenses from both Lgr4(-/-) and wild-type mice were subjected to oxidation induced protein denaturation to assess the ability of the lens to withstand oxidation. The expression of antioxidant enzymes was evaluated with real-time quantitative PCR. Phenotypically Lgr4(-/-) mice showed earlier onset of lens opacification and higher incidence of cataract formation compared with wild-type mice of similar age. In addition Lgr4(-/-) mice demonstrated increased sensitivity to environmental oxidative damage as evidenced by altered protein expression. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that two prominent antioxidant defense enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxidase dismutase-1 (SOD1) were significantly decreased in the lens epithelial cells of Lgr4(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that the deletion of Lgr4 can lead to premature cataract formation as well as progressive deterioration with aging.

"Loss-of-function mutations in RAB18 cause Warburg micro syndrome",NA,NA,NA,"Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome are heterogenous autosomal-recessive developmental disorders characterized by brain eye and endocrine abnormalities. Previously identification of mutations in RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 in both these syndromes implicated dysregulation of the RAB3 cycle (which controls calcium-mediated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones) in disease pathogenesis. RAB3GAP1 and RAB3GAP2 encode the catalytic and noncatalytic subunits of the hetrodimeric enzyme RAB3GAP (RAB3GTPase-activating protein) a key regulator of the RAB3 cycle. We performed autozygosity mapping in five consanguineous families without RAB3GAP1/2 mutations and identified loss-of-function mutations in RAB18. A c.71T > A (p.Leu24Gln) founder mutation was identified in four Pakistani families and a homozygous exon 2 deletion (predicted to result in a frameshift) was found in the fifth family. A single family whose members were compound heterozygotes for an anti-termination mutation of the stop codon c.619T > C (p.X207QextX20) and an inframe arginine deletion c.277_279 del (p.Arg93 del) were identified after direct gene sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of a further 58 families. Nucleotide binding assays for RAB18(Leu24Gln) and RAB18(Arg93del) showed that these mutant proteins were functionally null in that they were unable to bind guanine. The clinical features of Warburg Micro syndrome patients with RAB3GAP1 or RAB3GAP2 mutations and RAB18 mutations are indistinguishable although the role of RAB18 in trafficking is still emerging and it has not been linked previously to the RAB3 pathway. Knockdown of rab18 in zebrafish suggests that it might have a conserved developmental role.

"Three deaf mice: mouse models for TECTA-based human hereditary deafness reveal domain-specific structural phenotypes in the tectorial membrane",NA,NA,NA,"Tecta is a modular non-collagenous protein of the tectorial membrane (TM) an extracellular matrix of the cochlea essential for normal hearing. Missense mutations in Tecta cause dominant forms of non-syndromic deafness and a genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported in humans with mutations in different Tecta domains causing mid- or high-frequency hearing impairments that are either stable or progressive. Three mutant mice were created as models for human Tecta mutations; the Tecta(L1820FG1824D/+) mouse for zona pellucida (ZP) domain mutations causing stable mid-frequency hearing loss in a Belgian family the Tecta(C1837G/+) mouse for a ZP-domain mutation underlying progressive mid-frequency hearing loss in a Spanish family and the Tecta(C1619S/+) mouse for a zonadhesin-like (ZA) domain mutation responsible for progressive high-frequency hearing loss in a French family. Mutations in the ZP and ZA domains generate distinctly different changes in the structure of the TM. Auditory brainstem response thresholds in the 8-40 kHz range are elevated by 30-40 dB in the ZP-domain mutants whilst those in the ZA-domain mutant are elevated by 20-30 dB. The phenotypes are stable and no evidence has been found for a progressive deterioration in TM structure or auditory function. Despite elevated auditory thresholds the Tecta mutant mice all exhibit an enhanced tendency to have audiogenic seizures in response to white noise stimuli at low sound pressure levels (â¤84 dB SPL) revealing a previously unrecognised consequence of Tecta mutations.

"Postnatal disruption of the disintegrin/metalloproteinase ADAM10 in brain causes epileptic seizures learning deficits altered spine morphology and defective synaptic functions",NA,NA,NA,"The metalloproteinase ADAM10 is of importance for Notch-dependent cortical brain development. The protease is tightly linked with Î±-secretase activity toward the amyloid precursor protein (APP) substrate. Increasing ADAM10 activity is suggested as a therapy to prevent the production of the neurotoxic amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptide in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the function of ADAM10 in postnatal brain we generated Adam10 conditional knock-out (A10cKO) mice using a CaMKIIÎ±-Cre deleter strain. The lack of ADAM10 protein expression was evident in the brain cortex leading to a reduced generation of sAPPÎ± and increased levels of sAPPÎ² and endogenous AÎ² peptides. The A10cKO mice are characterized by weight loss and increased mortality after weaning associated with seizures. Behavioral comparison of adult mice revealed that the loss of ADAM10 in the A10cKO mice resulted in decreased neuromotor abilities and reduced learning performance which were associated with altered in vivo network activities in the hippocampal CA1 region and impaired synaptic function. Histological and ultrastructural analysis of ADAM10-depleted brain revealed astrogliosis microglia activation and impaired number and altered morphology of postsynaptic spine structures. A defect in spine morphology was further supported by a reduction of the expression of NMDA receptors subunit 2A and 2B. The reduced shedding of essential postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins such as N-Cadherin Nectin-1 and APP may explain the postsynaptic defects and the impaired learning altered network activity and synaptic plasticity of the A10cKO mice.

"The Sorting Receptor SorCS1 Regulates Trafficking of Neurexin and AMPA Receptors",NA,NA,NA,"The formation function and plasticity of synapses require dynamic changes in synaptic receptor composition. Here we identify the sorting receptor SorCS1 as a key regulator of synaptic receptor trafficking. Four independent proteomic analyses identify the synaptic adhesion molecule neurexin and the AMPA glutamate receptor (AMPAR) as major proteins sorted by SorCS1. SorCS1 localizes to early and recycling endosomes and regulates neurexin and AMPAR surface trafficking. Surface proteome analysis of SorCS1-deficient neurons shows decreased surface levels of these and additional receptors. Quantitative inÂ vivo analysis of SorCS1-knockout synaptic proteomes identifies SorCS1 as a global trafficking regulator and reveals decreased levels ofÂ receptors regulating adhesion and neurotransmission including neurexins and AMPARs. Consequently glutamatergic transmission at SorCS1-deficient synapses is reduced due to impaired AMPAR surface expression.

Peripheral T lymphocytes show an activated and anergic phenotype reduced viability and a restricted repertoire reminiscent of human leaky SCID. Genomic instability is associated with a high rate of thymic tumor development. Finally Lig4(R/R) mice spontaneously produce low-affinity antibodies that include autoreactive specificities but are unable to mount high-affinity antibody responses.

"N-myristoylation regulates the axonal distribution of the Fragile X-related protein FXR2P",NA,NA,NA,"Fragile X syndrome the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism is caused by loss of function of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA binding protein that regulates local protein synthesis in the somatodendritic compartment. However emerging evidence also indicates important roles for FMRP in axonal and presynaptic functions. In particular FMRP and its homologue FXR2P localize axonally and presynaptically to discrete endogenous structures in the brain termed Fragile X granules (FXGs). FXR2P is a component of all FXGs and is necessary for the axonal and presynaptic localization of FMRP to these structures. We therefore sought to identify and characterize structural features of FXR2P that regulate its axonal localization. Sequence analysis reveals that FXR2P harbors a consensus N-terminal myristoylation sequence (MGXXXS) that is absent in FMRP. Using click chemistry with wild type and an unmyristoylatable G2A mutant we demonstrate that FXR2P is N-myristoylated on glycine 2 establishing it as a lipid-modified RNA binding protein. To investigate the role of FXR2P N-myristoylation in neurons we generated fluorescently tagged wild type and unmyristoylatable FXR2P (WT and G2A respectively) and expressed them in primary cortical cultures. Both FXR2P(WT) and FXR2P(G2A) are expressed at equivalent overall levels and are capable of forming FMRP-containing axonal granules. However FXR2P(WT) granules are largely restricted to proximal axonal segments while granules formed with unmyristoylatable FXR2P(G2A) are localized throughout the axonal arbor including in growth cones. These studies indicate that N-terminal myristoylation of the RNA binding protein FXR2P regulates its localization within the axonal arbor. Moreover since FMRP localization within axonal domains requires its association with FXR2P these findings suggest that FXR2P lipid modification is a control point for the axonal and presynaptic distribution of FMRP.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-25109237"
"Perineuronal Nets Suppress Plasticity of Excitatory Synapses on CA2 Pyramidal Neurons",NA,NA,NA,"Long-term potentiation of excitatory synapses on pyramidal neurons in the stratum radiatum rarely occurs in hippocampal area CA2. Here we present evidence that perineuronal nets (PNNs) a specialized extracellular matrix typically localized around inhibitory neurons also surround mouse CA2 pyramidal neurons and envelop their excitatory synapses. CA2 pyramidal neurons express mRNA transcripts for the major PNN component aggrecan identifying these neurons as a novel source for PNNs in the hippocampus. We also found that disruption of PNNs allows synaptic potentiation of normally plasticity-resistant excitatory CA2 synapses; thus PNNs play a role in restricting synaptic plasticity in area CA2. Finally we found that postnatal development of PNNs on CA2 pyramidal neurons is modified by early-life enrichment suggesting that the development of circuits containing CA2 excitatory synapses are sensitive to manipulations of the rearing environment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are thought to play a major role in restricting synaptic plasticity during postnatal development and are altered in several models of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and Rett syndrome. Although PNNs have been predominantly studied in association with inhibitory neurons throughout the brain we describe a dense expression of PNNs around excitatory pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2. We also provide insight into a previously unrecognized role for PNNs in restricting plasticity at excitatory synapses and raise the possibility of an early critical period of hippocampal plasticity that may ultimately reveal a key mechanism underlying learning and memory impairments of PNN-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-27277807"
"NFAT dysregulation by increased dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A on chromosome 21",NA,NA,NA,"Trisomy 21 results in Down's syndrome but little is known about how a 1.5-fold increase in gene dosage produces the pleiotropic phenotypes of Down's syndrome. Here we report that two genes DSCR1 and DYRK1A  lie within the critical region of human chromosome 21 and act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription factors which are regulators of vertebrate development. We use mathematical modelling to predict that autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of DSCR1 and DYRK1A leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes under specific conditions. Our observations of calcineurin-and Nfatc-deficient mice Dscr1- and Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice mouse models of Down's syndrome and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these predictions. We suggest that the 1.5-fold increase in dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory circuit leading to reduced NFATc activity and many of the features of Down's syndrome. More generally these observations suggest that the destabilization of regulatory circuits can underlie human disease.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-16554754"
"Role of an adaptor protein Lin-7B in brain development: possible involvement in autism spectrum disorders",NA,NA,NA,"Using comparative genomic hybridization analysis for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patient a 73-Kb duplication at 19q13.33 (nt. 49Â 562Â 755-49Â 635Â 956) including LIN7B and 5 other genes was detected. We then identified a novel frameshift mutation in LIN7B in another ASD patient. Since LIN7B encodes a scaffold protein essential for neuronal function we analyzed the role of Lin-7B in the development of cerebral cortex. Acute knockdown of Lin-7B with in utero electroporation caused a delay in neuronal migration during corticogenesis. When Lin-7B was knocked down in cortical neurons in one hemisphere their axons failed to extend efficiently into the contralateral hemisphere after leaving the corpus callosum. Meanwhile enhanced expression of Lin-7B had no effects on both cortical neuron migration and axon growth. Notably silencing of Lin-7B did not affect the proliferation of neuronal progenitors and stem cells. Taken together Lin-7B was found to play a pivotal role in corticogenesis through the regulation of excitatory neuron migration and interhemispheric axon growth while further analyses are required to directly link functional defects of Lin-7B to ASD pathophysiology. Lin-7 plays a pivotal role as a scaffold protein in synaptic development and plasticity. Based on genetic analyses we identified mutations in LIN-7B gene in some ASD (autism-spectrum disorder) patients. Functional defects in Lin-7B caused abnormal neuronal migration and interhemispheric axon growth during mouse brain development. Thus functional deficiency in Lin-7B could be implicated in clinical phenotypes in some ASD patients through bringing about abnormal cortical architecture.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-25196215"
"Hippocampal overexpression of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice",NA,NA,NA,"Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is located within the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. DSCAM is a broadly expressed neurodevelopmental protein involved in synaptogenesis neurite outgrowth and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated DSCAM overexpression in the cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice suggesting possible regulatory interactions between APP and DSCAM. APP mice exhibit deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In this preliminary study we examined age-related changes in DSCAM expression within the hippocampus in 16 APP transgenic mice (1 3 6 and 12 months old). Hippocampus-dependent spatial memory was assessed in APP mice and age-matched wild type littermates (WTs) using the Morris water maze (MWM). The cellular distribution of hippocampal DSCAM and total expression at both mRNA and protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry qRT-PCR and western blotting respectively. APP mice exhibited spatial memory deficits in the MWM. Intense DSCAM immunoreactivity was observed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and hippocampal stratum pyramidale. Total hippocampal DSCAM mRNA and protein expression levels were substantially higher in APP mice than WTs at 1 and 3 months of age. Expression decreased with age in both groups but remained higher in APP mice. DSCAM is overexpressed in the hippocampus over the first 12 months of life in APP mice but especially during maturation to adulthood. In conclusion these results suggest an association between DSCAM and APP mice which is characterized by neuropathology and behavioral deficits. These results provide some clues for future studies on the role of DSCAM overexpression in the precocious cognitive decline observed in APP transgenic mice.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-28513774"

We report a microduplication in the 10q26.3 region including part of the Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase A (INPP5A) gene that segregates with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) in the family of a female patient affected by both COS and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Phenotyping and genotyping (including CGH-array) were performed for mother, healthy sister, and affected child according to the GenAuDiss protocol (NCT02565524). The duplication size is 324 kb and is present in a patient with COS and in her mother with SSD, but not in the patient's healthy sister. INPP5A encodes a membrane-associated 43 kDa type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 5-phosphatase.

Hydrolyzed products from InsP3 5-phosphatases mobilize intracellular calcium, which is relevant for dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons and altered in both schizophrenia and ASD.

"X-linked ichthyosis (steroid sulfatase deficiency) is associated with increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism and social communication deficits",NA,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) (steroid sulfatase deficiency) is caused by deletions or point mutations of the steroid sulfatase (STS) gene on chromosome Xp22.32. Deletions of this region can be associated with cognitive behavioural difficulties including autism. Animal work suggests the STS gene may be involved in attentional processes. We have therefore undertaken a systematic study of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in boys with XLI. METHODS: Cases of XLI were recruited from families originally ascertained when pregnancies with STS deficiency were identified through a routine maternal screening programme. Boys with XLI were assessed for ADHD and autism using standardised questionnaires and interviews. Deletions of the STS gene were identified and characterised by analysis of genomic DNA and/or fluorescent in situ hybridisation. RESULTS: 25 boys with XLI were assessed for autism and ADHD. 40% fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD 80% of which were inattentive subtype. ADHD diagnoses were present in those with both deletions and presumed point mutations of STS. Additionally five boys from three unrelated families fulfilled criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder or related language/communication difficulty and all had an unusually large deletion of the STS gene with loss of the neuroligin 4 (NLGN4) gene. None of the boys with the typical deletion or presumed point mutations of STS demonstrated autistic difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: STS deficiency may be a risk factor for ADHD with predominantly inattentive symptoms. Boys with XLI and large deletions encompassing STS and NLGN4 are at increased risk of developing autism and related disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-18413370"
"C3G regulates cortical neuron migration preplate splitting and radial glial cell attachment",NA,NA,NA,"Neuronal migration is integral to the development of the cerebral cortex and higher brain function. Cortical neuron migration defects lead to mental disorders such as lissencephaly and epilepsy. Interaction of neurons with their extracellular environment regulates cortical neuron migration through cell surface receptors. However it is unclear how the signals from extracellular matrix proteins are transduced intracellularly. We report here that mouse embryos lacking the Ras family guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (Rapgef1 Grf2) exhibit a cortical neuron migration defect resulting in a failure to split the preplate into marginal zone and subplate and a failure to form a cortical plate. C3G-deficient cortical neurons fail to migrate. Instead they arrest in a multipolar state and accumulate below the preplate. The basement membrane is disrupted and radial glial processes are disorganised and lack attachment in C3G-deficient brains. C3G is activated in response to reelin in cortical neurons which in turn leads to activation of the small GTPase Rap1. In C3G-deficient cells Rap1 GTP loading in response to reelin stimulation is reduced. In conclusion the Ras family regulator C3G is essential for two aspects of cortex development namely radial glial attachment and neuronal migration.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-18506028"

GABA neurotransmission is implicated in several developmental processes including neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Alteration in excitatory/inhibitory synaptic activities plays a critical role in epilepsy thus here we investigated whether mutations in Î±1 subunit of GABAA receptor may affect dendritic spine and GABAergic bouton formation. In particular we examined the effects of three mutations of the GABRA1 gene (D219N A322D and K353delins18X) that were found in a cohort of French Canadian families with genetic generalized epilepsy. We used a novel single-cell genetic approach by preparing cortical organotypic cultures from GABRA1 (flox/flox) mice and simultaneously inactivating endogenous GABRA1 and transfecting mutant Î±1 subunits in single glutamatergic pyramidal cells and basket GABAergic interneurons by biolistic transfection. We found that GABRA1 (-/-) GABAergic cells showed reduced innervation field which was rescued by co-expressing Î±1-A322D and Î±1-WT but not Î±1-D219N. We further found that the expression of the most severe GABRA1 missense mutation (Î±1-A322D) induced a striking increase of spine density in pyramidal cells along with an increase in the number of mushroom-like spines. In addition Î±1-A322D expression in GABAergic cells slightly increased perisomatic bouton density whereas other mutations did not alter bouton formation. All together these results suggest that the effects of different GABAAR mutations on GABAergic bouton and dendritic spine formation are specific to the mutation and cannot be always explained by a simple loss-of-function gene model. The use of single cell genetic manipulation in organotypic cultures may provide a better understanding of the specific and distinct neural circuit alterations caused by different GABAA receptor subunit mutations and will help define the pathophysiology of genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-25352779"
"Abnormal Expression of Synaptic and Extrasynaptic GABA(A) Receptor Subunits in the Dystrophin-Deficient mdx Mouse",NA,NA,NA,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily caused by the loss of the full-length Dp427 dystrophin in both muscle and brain. The basis of the central comorbidities in DMD is unclear. Brain dystrophin plays a role in the clustering of central gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and its loss in the mdx mouse alters the clustering of some synaptic subunits in central inhibitory synapses. However the diversity of GABAergic alterations in this model is still fragmentary. In this study the analysis of in vivo PET imaging of a benzodiazepine-binding site radioligand revealed that the global density of central GABA(A)Rs is unaffected in mdx compared with WT mice. In contrast semi-quantitative immunoblots and immunofluorescence confocal imaging in tissue sections revealed complex and differential patterns of alterations of the expression levels and/or clustered distribution of a variety of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)R subunits in the hippocampus cerebellum cortex and spinal cord. Hence dystrophin loss not only affects the stabilization of synaptic GABA(A)Rs but also influences the subunit composition of GABA(A)Rs subtypes at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. This study provides new molecular outcome measures and new routes to evaluate the impact of treatments aimed at compensating alterations of the nervous system in DMD.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-36293496"
"RCAN1 knockout and overexpression recapitulate an ensemble of rest-activity and circadian disruptions characteristic of Down syndrome Alzheimer's disease and normative aging",NA,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) is overexpressed in Down syndrome (DS) but RCAN1 levels are also increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging. AD is highly comorbid among individuals with DS and is characterized in part by progressive neurodegeneration that resembles accelerated aging. Importantly abnormal RCAN1 levels have been demonstrated to promote memory deficits and pathophysiology that appear symptomatic of DS AD and aging. Anomalous diurnal rest-activity patterns and circadian rhythm disruptions are also common in DS AD and aging and have been implicated in facilitating age-related cognitive decline and AD progression. However no prior studies have assessed whether RCAN1 dysregulation may also promote the age-associated alteration of rest-activity profiles and circadian rhythms which could in turn contribute to neurodegeneration in DS AD and aging. METHODS: The present study examined the impacts of RCAN1 deficiency and overexpression on the photic entrainment circadian periodicity intensity and distribution diurnal patterning and circadian rhythmicity of wheel running in young (3-6 months old) and aged (9-14 months old) mice of both sexes. RESULTS: We found that daily RCAN1 levels in the hippocampus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of light-entrained young mice are generally constant and that balanced RCAN1 expression is necessary for normal circadian locomotor activity rhythms. While the light-entrained diurnal period was unaltered RCAN1-null and RCAN1-overexpressing mice displayed lengthened endogenous (free-running) circadian periods like mouse models of AD and aging. In light-entrained young mice RCAN1 deficiency and overexpression also recapitulated the general hypoactivity diurnal rest-wake pattern fragmentation and attenuated amplitudes of circadian activity rhythms reported in DS preclinical and clinical AD healthily aging individuals and rodent models thereof. Under constant darkness RCAN1-null and RCAN1-overexpressing mice displayed altered locomotor behavior indicating circadian clock dysfunction. Using the Dp(16)1Yey/+ (Dp16) mouse model for DS which expresses three copies of Rcan1 we found reduced wheel running activity and rhythmicity in both light-entrained and free-running young Dp16 mice like young RCAN1-overexpressing mice. Critically these diurnal and circadian deficits were rescued in part or entirely by restoring Rcan1 to two copies in Dp16 mice. We also found that RCAN1 deficiency but not RCAN1 overexpression altered protein levels of the clock gene Bmal1 in the SCN. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively this study's findings suggest that both loss and aberrant gain of RCAN1 precipitate anomalous light-entrained diurnal and circadian activity patterns emblematic of DS AD and possibly aging.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-35610565"
"Discovery of autism/intellectual disability somatic mutations in Alzheimer's brains: mutated ADNP cytoskeletal impairments and repair as a case study",NA,NA,NA,"With Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibiting reduced ability of neural stem cell renewal, we hypothesized that de novo mutations controlling embryonic development, in the form of brain somatic mutations instigate the disease. A leading gene presenting heterozygous dominant de novo autism-intellectual disabilities (ID) causing mutations is activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), with intact ADNP protecting against AD-tauopathy. We discovered a genomic autism ADNP mutation (c.2188C>T) in postmortem AD olfactory bulbs and hippocampi. RNA-Seq of olfactory bulbs also identified a novel ADNP hotspot mutation, c.2187_2188insA. Altogether, 665 mutations in 596 genes with 441 mutations in AD patients (389 genes, 38% AD-exclusive mutations) and 104 genes presenting disease-causing mutations (OMIM) were discovered. OMIM AD mutated genes converged on cytoskeletal mechanisms, autism and ID causing mutations (about 40% each). The number and average frequencies of AD-related mutations per subject were higher in AD subjects compared to controls. RNA-seq datamining (hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus-583 subjects) yielded similar results. Overlapping all tested brain areas identified unique and shared mutations, with ADNP singled out as a gene associated with autism/ID/AD and presenting several unique aging/AD mutations. The large fusiform gyrus library (117 subjects) with high sequencing coverage correlated the c.2187_2188insA ADNP mutation frequency to Braak stage (tauopathy) and showed more ADNP mutations in AD specimens. In cell cultures, the ADNP-derived snippet NAP inhibited mutated-ADNP-microtubule (MT) toxicity and enhanced Tau-MT association. We propose a paradigm-shifting concept in the perception of AD whereby accumulating mosaic somatic mutations promote brain pathology.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"wos-000823159800001"
"GAT-1 regulates both tonic and phasic GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in the cerebral cortex",NA,NA,NA,"Î³-Aminobutyric acid 1 (GAT-1) is the most copiously expressed GABA transporter; we studied its role in phasic and tonic inhibition in the neocortex using GAT-1 knockout (KO) mice. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemical studies showed that GAT-2 and GAT-3 levels in KOs were unchanged and that GAT-3 was not redistributed in KOs. Moreover, the expression of GAD65/67 was increased, whereas that of GABA or VGAT was unchanged. Microdialysis studies showed that in KOs spontaneous extracellular release of GABA and glutamate was comparable in WT and KO mice, whereas KCl-evoked output of GABA, but not of glutamate, was significantly increased in KOs. Recordings from layer II/III pyramids revealed a significant increase in GABAAR-mediated tonic conductance in KO mice. The frequency, amplitude and kinetics of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were unchanged, whereas the decay time of evoked IPSCs was significantly prolonged in KO mice. In KO mice, high frequency stimulation of GABAergic terminals induced large GABAAR-mediated inward currents associated with a reduction in amplitude and decay time of IPSCs evoked immediately after the train. The recovery process was slower in KO than in WT mice. These studies show that in the cerebral cortex of GAT-1 KO mice GAT-3 is not redistributed and GADs are adaptively changed and indicate that GAT-1 has a prominent role in both tonic and phasic GABAAR-mediated inhibition, in particular during sustained neuronal activity.

"Evolution of the Autism-Associated Neuroligin-4 Gene Reveals Broad Erosion of Pseudoautosomal Regions in Rodents",NA,NA,NA,"Variants in genes encoding synaptic adhesion proteins of the neuroligin family most notably neuroligin-4 are a significant cause of autism spectrum disorders in humans. Although human neuroligin-4 is encoded by two genes NLGN4X and NLGN4Y that are localized on the X-specific and male-specific regions of the two sex chromosomes the chromosomal localization and full genomic sequence of the mouse Nlgn4 gene remain elusive. Here we analyzed the neuroligin-4 genes of numerous rodent species by direct sequencing and bioinformatics generated complete drafts of multiple rodent neuroligin-4 genes and examined their evolution. Surprisingly we find that the murine Nlgn4 gene is localized to the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the sex chromosomes different from its human orthologs. We show that the sequence differences between various neuroligin-4 proteins are restricted to hotspots in which rodent neuroligin-4 proteins contain short repetitive sequence insertions compared with neuroligin-4 proteins from other species whereas all other protein sequences are highly conserved. Evolutionarily these sequence insertions initiate in the clade eumuroidea of the infraorder myomorpha and are additionally associated with dramatic changes in noncoding sequences and gene size. Importantly these changes are not exclusively restricted to neuroligin-4 genes but reflect major evolutionary changes that substantially altered or even deleted genes from the PARs of both sex chromosomes. Our results show that despite the fact that the PAR in rodents and the neuroligin-4 genes within the rodent PAR underwent massive evolutionary changes neuroligin-4 proteins maintained a highly conserved core structure consistent with a substantial evolutionary pressure preserving its physiological function.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-32011705"
"NKCC1-Mediated GABAergic Signaling Promotes Postnatal Cell Death in Neocortical Cajal-Retzius Cells",NA,NA,NA,"During early development a substantial proportion of central neurons undergoes programmed cell death. This activity-dependent process is essential for the proper structural and functional development of the brain. To uncover cell type-specific differences in the regulation of neuronal survival versus apoptosis we studied activity-regulated cell death in Cajal-Retzius neurons (CRNs) and the overall neuronal population in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. CRNs in the upper neocortical layer represent an early-born neuronal population which is important for cortical development and largely disappears by apoptosis during neonatal stages. In contrast to the overall neuronal population activity blockade with tetrodotoxin improved survival of CRNs in culture. Activation of GABAA receptors also blocked spontaneous activity and caused overall cell death including apoptosis of CRNs. Blockade of the Na-K-Cl transporter NKCC1 in vitro or its genetic deletion in vivo rescued CRNs from apoptosis. This effect was mediated by blockade of the p75NTR receptor signaling pathway. In summary we discovered a novel developmental death pathway mediated by NKCC1 via GABAA receptor-mediated membrane depolarization and p75NTR signaling in CRNs. This pathway controls apoptosis of CRNs and may be critically involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-26819276"
"DSCAM localization and function at the mouse cone synapse",NA,NA,NA,"The Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is required for regulation of cell number soma spacing and cell type-specific dendrite avoidance in many types of retinal ganglion and amacrine cells. In this study we assay the organization of cells making up the outer plexiform layer of the retina in the absence of Dscam. Some types of OFF bipolar cells type 3b and type 4 bipolar cells had defects in dendrite arborization in the Dscam mutant retina whereas other cell types appeared similar to wild type. The cone synapses that these cells project their dendrites to were intact as visualized by electron microscopy and had a distribution and density that was not significantly different from that of wild type. The spacing of type 3b bipolar cell dendrites was further analyzed by Voronoi domain analysis density recovery profiling (DRP) analysis and nearest neighbor analysis. Spacing was found to be significantly different when wild-type and mutant type 3b bipolar cell dendrites were compared. Defects in arborization of these bipolar cells could not be attributed to the disorganization of inner plexiform layer cells that occurs in the Dscam mutant retina or an increase in cell number as they arborized when Dscam was targeted in retinal ganglion cells only or in the bax null retina. Localization of DSCAM was assayed and the protein was localized near to cone synapses in mouse macaque and ground squirrel retinas.

"Functional screening of 2 Mb of human chromosome 21q22.2 in transgenic mice implicates minibrain in learning defects associated with Down syndrome",NA,NA,NA,"Using Down syndrome as a model for complex trait analysis we sought to identify loci from chromosome 21q22.2 which when present in an extra dose contribute to learning abnormalities. We generated low-copy-number transgenic mice containing four different yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) that together cover approximately 2 megabases (Mb) of contiguous DNA from 21q22.2. We subjected independent lines derived from each of these YAC transgenes to a series of behavioural and learning assays. Two of the four YACs caused defects in learning and memory in the transgenic animals while the other two YACs had no effect. The most severe defects were caused by a 570-kb YAC; the interval responsible for these defects was narrowed to a 180-kb critical region as a consequence of YAC fragmentation. This region contains the human homologue of a Drosophila gene minibrain and strongly implicates it in learning defects associated with Down syndrome.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-9140392"
"Animal model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproate: behavioral changes and liver parameters",NA,NA,NA,"Autism is characterized by behavioral impairments in three main domains: social interaction; language communication and imaginative play; and range of interests and activities. This syndrome has attracted social attention by its high prevalence. The animal model induced by prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has been proposed to study autism. Several characteristics of behavioral abnormalities found in the VPA rats such as repetitive/stereotypic-like activity and deficit in social interaction have been correlated with autism. Features like flexibility to change strategy social memory and metabolic status of the induced rats have not been examined. Thus the main aim of this work was to investigate additional behavioral rodent similarities with autism as well as liver redox parameters after prenatal exposure to VPA. Young rats from the VPA group presented aberrant approach to a stranger rat decreased conditioned place preference to conspecifics normal spatial learning and a lack of flexibility to change their strategy. As adults they presented inappropriate social approach to a stranger rat decreased preference for social novelty apparently normal social recognition and no spatial learning deficits. Examination of the liver from the VPA group presented significantly increased (12%) levels of catalase (CAT) activity no alteration in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a decrease in the SOD/CAT ratio. TBARS sulfhydril and carbonyl contents and serum levels of aminotransferases remained unchanged.

"Social Communication in Mice - Are There Optimal Cage Conditions?",NA,NA,NA,"Social communication is heavily affected in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Accordingly, mouse models designed to study the mechanisms leading to these disorders are tested for this phenotypic trait. Test conditions vary between different models, and the effect of these test conditions on the quantity and quality of social interactions and ultrasonic communication is unknown. The present study examines to which extent the habituation time to the test cage as well as the shape / size of the cage influence social communication in freely interacting mice. We tested 8 pairs of male mice in free dyadic social interactions, with two habituation times (20 min and 30 min) and three cage formats (rectangle, round, square). We tested the effect of these conditions on the different types of social contacts, approach-escape sequences, follow behavior, and the time each animal spent in the vision field of the other one, as well as on the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations and their contexts of emission. We provide for the first time an integrated analysis of the social interaction behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations. Surprisingly, we did not highlight any significant effect of habituation time and cage shape / size on the behavioral events examined. There was only a slight increase of social interactions with the longer habituation time in the round cage. Remarkably, we also showed that vocalizations were emitted during specific behavioral sequences especially during close contact or approach behaviors. The present study provides a protocol reliably eliciting social contacts and ultrasonic vocalizations in adult male mice. This protocol is therefore well adapted for standardized investigation of social interactions in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"wos-000351880000181"
"Contralateral cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways with prominent involvement of associative areas in humans in vivo",NA,NA,NA,"In addition to motor functions it has become clear that in humans the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognition too through connections with associative areas in the cerebral cortex. Classical anatomy indicates that neo-cerebellar regions are connected with the contralateral cerebral cortex through the dentate nucleus superior cerebellar peduncle red nucleus and ventrolateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anatomical existence of these connections has been demonstrated using virus retrograde transport techniques in monkeys and rats ex vivo. In this study using advanced diffusion MRI tractography we show that it is possible to calculate streamlines to reconstruct the pathway connecting the cerebellar cortex with contralateral cerebral cortex in humans in vivo. Corresponding areas of the cerebellar and cerebral cortex encompassed similar proportion (about 80%) of the tract suggesting that the majority of streamlines passing through the superior cerebellar peduncle connect the cerebellar hemispheres through the ventrolateral thalamus with contralateral associative areas. This result demonstrates that this kind of tractography is a useful tool to map connections between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex and moreover could be used to support specific theories about the abnormal communication along these pathways in cognitive dysfunctions in pathologies ranging from dyslexia to autism.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-25134682"
"Methyllycaconitine fails to inhibit electrically precipitated tonic hindlimb extension in mice",NA,NA,NA,"Abnormalities of the transduction of the acetylcholine signal in the brain by the alpha(7) nicotinic receptor are thought to contribute substantially to a fundamental pathophysiologic mechanism in schizophrenia. Abnormal or diminished expression of the alpha(7) nicotinic receptor polypeptide subunit in the brains of patients with schizophrenia has encouraged consideration of the development of alpha(7) nicotinic receptor agonist strategies for the treatment of this disorder. These strategies would target negative symptoms and attentional and cognitive abnormalities which are domains of psychopathology that are associated with very poor functional outcomes and disability. Unfortunately a major theoretic limitation to the development of alpha(7) nicotinic receptor agonist interventions for the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia is the development of seizures. In the current study intraperitoneally administered methyllycaconitine a selective alpha(7) nicotinic receptor antagonist was shown to be unable to antagonize electrically precipitated seizures in mice. These data suggest that the alpha(7) nicotinic receptor does not mediate this type of seizure activity in mice. Also although the medication-induced emergence of seizure activity remains a real concern with the development of alpha(7) nicotinic receptor agonist strategies the data suggest that there should be lessened concern about precipitating seizures related to electrically precipitated tonic hindlimb extension in mice.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-12671524"
"Histone H3K36me2-Specific Methyltransferase ASH1L Promotes MLL-AF9-Induced Leukemogenesis",NA,NA,NA,"ASH1L and MLL1 are two histone methyltransferases that facilitate transcriptional activation during normal development. However the roles of ASH1L and its enzymatic activity in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemias are not fully elucidated in Ash1L gene knockout animal models. In this study we used an Ash1L conditional knockout mouse model to show that loss of ASH1L in hematopoietic progenitor cells impaired the initiation of MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation in vitro. Furthermore genetic deletion of ASH1L in the MLL-AF9-transformed cells impaired the maintenance of leukemic cells in vitro and largely blocked the leukemia progression in vivo. Importantly the loss of ASH1L function in the Ash1L-deleted cells could be rescued by wild-type but not the catalytic-dead mutant ASH1L suggesting the enzymatic activity of ASH1L was required for its function in promoting MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation. At the molecular level ASH1L enhanced the MLL-AF9 target gene expression by directly binding to the gene promoters and modifying the local histone H3K36me2 levels. Thus our study revealed the critical functions of ASH1L in promoting the MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis which provides a molecular basis for targeting ASH1L and its enzymatic activity to treat MLL-AF9-induced leukemias.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-34692539"
"Gata4 regulates hedgehog signaling and Gata6 expression for outflow tract development",NA,NA,NA,"Dominant mutations of Gata4 an essential cardiogenic transcription factor (TF) were known to cause outflow tract (OFT) defects in both human and mouse but the underlying molecular mechanism was not clear. In this study Gata4 haploinsufficiency in mice was found to result in OFT defects including double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and ventricular septum defects (VSDs). Gata4 was shown to be required for Hedgehog (Hh)-receiving progenitors within the second heart field (SHF) for normal OFT alignment. Restored cell proliferation in the SHF by knocking-down Pten failed to rescue OFT defects suggesting that additional cell events under Gata4 regulation is important. SHF Hh-receiving cells failed to migrate properly into the proximal OFT cushion which is associated with abnormal EMT and cell proliferation in Gata4 haploinsufficiency. The genetic interaction of Hh signaling and Gata4 is further demonstrated to be important for OFT development. Gata4 and Smo double heterozygotes displayed more severe OFT abnormalities including persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA). Restoration of Hedgehog signaling renormalized SHF cell proliferation and migration and rescued OFT defects in Gata4 haploinsufficiency. In addition there was enhanced Gata6 expression in the SHF of the Gata4 heterozygotes. The Gata4-responsive repressive sites were identified within 1kbp upstream of the transcription start site of Gata6 by both ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assay.

"The metabotropic glutamate receptor activates the lipid kinase PI3K in Drosophila motor neurons through the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase DFak",NA,NA,NA,"Ligand activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activates the lipid kinase PI3K in both the mammalian central nervous system and Drosophila motor nerve terminal. In several subregions of the mammalian brain mGluR-mediated PI3K activation is essential for a form of synaptic plasticity termed long-term depression (LTD) which is implicated in neurological diseases such as fragile X and autism. In Drosophila larval motor neurons ligand activation of DmGluRA the sole Drosophila mGluR similarly mediates a PI3K-dependent downregulation of neuronal activity. The mechanism by which mGluR activates PI3K remains incompletely understood in either mammals or Drosophila. Here we identify CaMKII and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase DFak as critical intermediates in the DmGluRA-dependent activation of PI3K at Drosophila motor nerve terminals. We find that transgene-induced CaMKII inhibition or the DFak(CG1) null mutation each block the ability of glutamate application to activate PI3K in larval motor nerve terminals whereas transgene-induced CaMKII activation increases PI3K activity in motor nerve terminals in a DFak-dependent manner even in the absence of glutamate application. We also find that CaMKII activation induces other PI3K-dependent effects such as increased motor axon diameter and increased synapse number at the larval neuromuscular junction. CaMKII but not PI3K requires DFak activity for these increases. We conclude that the activation of PI3K by DmGluRA is mediated by CaMKII and DFak.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-21515581"

Based upon work in genetically modified mice 5-HT is known to influence several aspects of brain development but systematic neuroimaging studies have not previously been reported. In particular the 5-HT transporter (serotonin transporter SERT; 5-HTT) gene Slc6a4 has been extensively studied. METHODS: Using a 7-T MRI and deformation-based morphometry we assessed neuroanatomical differences in an Slc6a4 knockout mouse on a C57BL/6 genetic background along with an Slc6a4 Ala56 knockin mouse on two different genetic backgrounds (129S and C57BL/6). RESULTS: Individually (same sex same background same genotype) the only differences found were in the female Slc6a4 knockout mouse; all the others had no significant differences. However an analysis of variance across the whole study sample revealed a significant effect of Slc6a4 on the amygdala thalamus dorsal raphe nucleus and lateral and frontal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that an increase or decrease in SERT function has a significant effect on the neuroanatomy in 5-HT relevant regions particularly the raphe nuclei. Notably the Slc6a4 Ala56 knockin alone appears to have an insignificant but suggestive effect compared to the KO which is consistent with Slc6a4 function. Despite the small number of 5-HT neurons and their localization to the brainstem it is clear that 5-HT plays an important role in neuroanatomical organization.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-29651330"

"Functional and biochemical analysis of a sodium channel beta1 subunit mutation responsible for generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type 1",NA,NA,NA,"Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type 1 is an inherited human epileptic syndrome associated with a cysteine-to-tryptophan (C121W) mutation in the extracellular immunoglobin domain of the auxiliary beta1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel. The mutation disrupts beta1 function but how this leads to epilepsy is not understood. In this study we make several observations that may be relevant for understanding why this beta1 mutation results in seizures. First using electrophysiological recordings from mammalian cell lines coexpressing sodium channel alpha subunits and either wild-type beta1 or C121Wbeta1 we show that loss of beta1 functional modulation caused by the C121W mutation leads to increased sodium channel availability at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced sodium channel rundown during high-frequency channel activity compared with channels coexpressed with wild-type beta1. In contrast neither wild-type beta1 nor C121Wbeta1 significantly affected sodium current time course or the voltage dependence of channel activation. We also show using a Drosophila S2 cell adhesion assay that the C121W mutation disrupts beta1-beta1 homophilic cell adhesion suggesting that the mutation may alter the ability of beta1 to mediate protein-protein interactions critical for sodium channel localization. Finally we demonstrate that neither functional modulation nor cell adhesion mediated by wild-type beta1 is occluded by coexpression of C121Wbeta1 arguing against the idea that the mutant beta1 acts as a dominant-negative subunit. Together these data suggest that C121Wbeta1 causes subtle effects on channel function and subcellular distribution that bias neurons toward hyperexcitabity and epileptogenesis.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-12486163"
"Biallelic variants in LIG3 cause a novel mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy",NA,NA,NA,"Abnormal gut motility is a feature of several mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and mutations in genes such as TYMP and POLG have been linked to these rare diseases. The human genome encodes three DNA ligases of which only one ligase III (LIG3) has a mitochondrial splice variant and is crucial for mitochondrial health. We investigated the effect of reduced LIG3 activity and resulting mitochondrial dysfunction in seven patients from three independent families who showed the common occurrence of gut dysmotility and neurological manifestations reminiscent of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy. DNA from these patients was subjected to whole exome sequencing. In all patients compound heterozygous variants in a new disease gene LIG3 were identified. All variants were predicted to have a damaging effect on the protein. The LIG3 gene encodes the only mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ligase and therefore plays a pivotal role in mtDNA repair and replication. In vitro assays in patient-derived cells showed a decrease in LIG3 protein levels and ligase activity. We demonstrated that the LIG3 gene defects affect mtDNA maintenance leading to mtDNA depletion without the accumulation of multiple deletions as observed in other mitochondrial disorders. This mitochondrial dysfunction is likely to cause the phenotypes observed in these patients. The most prominent and consistent clinical signs were severe gut dysmotility and neurological abnormalities including leukoencephalopathy epilepsy migraine stroke-like episodes and neurogenic bladder. A decrease in the number of myenteric neurons and increased fibrosis and elastin levels were the most prominent changes in the gut. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficient fibres in skeletal muscle were also observed. Disruption of lig3 in zebrafish reproduced the brain alterations and impaired gut transit in vivo. In conclusion we identified variants in the LIG3 gene that result in a mitochondrial disease characterized by predominant gut dysmotility encephalopathy and neuromuscular abnormalities.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-33855352"
"What Gene Mutations Affect Serotonin in Mice?",NA,NA,NA,"Although serotonin neurotransmission has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychological disorders, the factors that drive dysfunction of the serotonin system are poorly understood. Current research regarding the serotonin system revolves around its dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders, but there is no database collating genetic mutations that result in serotonin abnormalities. To bridge this gap, we developed a list of genes in mice that, when perturbed, result in altered levels of serotonin either in brain or blood. Due to the intrinsic limitations of search, the current list should be considered a preliminary subset of all relevant cases. Nevertheless, it offered an opportunity to gain insight into what types of genes have the potential to impact serotonin by using gene ontology (GO). This analysis found that genes associated with monoamine metabolism were more often associated with increases in brain serotonin than decreases. Speculatively, this could be because several pathways (and therefore many genes) are responsible for the clearance and metabolism of serotonin whereas only one pathway (and therefore fewer genes) is directly involved in the synthesis of serotonin. Another contributor could be cross talk between monoamine systems such as dopamine. In contrast, genes that were associated with decreases in brain serotonin were more likely linked to a developmental process. Sensitivity of serotonin neurons to developmental perturbations could be due to their complicated neuroanatomy or possibly they may be negatively regulated by dysfunction of their innervation targets. Thus, these observations suggest hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability of brain serotonin neurotransmission.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"wos-000401781800012"
"A Spontaneous Missense Mutation in Branched Chain Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Kinase in the Rat Affects Both the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems",NA,NA,NA,"A novel mutation causing a phenotype we named frogleg because its most obvious characteristic is a severe splaying of the hind limbs arose spontaneously in a colony of Sprague-Dawley rats. Frogleg is a complex phenotype that includes abnormalities in hind limb function reduced brain weight with dilated ventricles and infertility. Using micro-satellite markers spanning the entire rat genome the mutation was mapped to a region of rat chromosome 1 between D1Rat131 and D1Rat287. Analysis of whole genome sequencing data within the linkage interval identified a missense mutation in the branched-chain alpha-keto dehydrogenase kinase (Bckdk) gene. The protein encoded by Bckdk is an integral part of an enzyme complex located in the mitochondrial matrix of many tissues which regulates the levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine isoleucine and valine. BCAAs are essential amino acids (not synthesized by the body) and circulating levels must be tightly regulated; levels that are too high or too low are both deleterious. BCKDK phosphorylates Ser293 of the E1Î± subunit of the BCKDH protein which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the catabolism of the BCAAs inhibiting BCKDH and thereby limiting breakdown of the BCAAs. In contrast when Ser293 is not phosphorylated BCKDH activity is unchecked and the levels of the BCAAs will decrease dramatically. The mutation is located within the kinase domain of Bckdk and is predicted to be damaging. Consistent with this we show that in rats homozygous for the mutation phosphorylation of BCKDH in the brain is markedly decreased relative to wild type or heterozygous littermates. Further circulating levels of the BCAAs are reduced by 70-80% in animals homozygous for the mutation. The frogleg phenotype shares important characteristics with a previously described Bckdk knockout mouse and with human subjects with Bckdk mutations. In addition we report novel data regarding peripheral neuropathy of the hind limbs.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-27472223"
"Animal models of restricted repetitive behavior in autism",NA,NA,NA,"Restricted, repetitive behavior, along with deficits in social reciprocity and communication, is diagnostic of autism. Animal models relevant to this domain generally fall into three classes: repetitive behavior associated with targeted insults to the CNS; repetitive behavior induced by pharmacological agents; and repetitive behavior associated with restricted environments and experience. The extant literature provides potential models of the repetitive behavioral phenotype in autism rather than attempts to model the etiology or pathophysiology of restricted, repetitive behavior, as these are poorly understood. This review focuses on our work with deer mice which exhibit repetitive behaviors associated with environmental restriction. Repetitive behaviors are the most common category of abnormal behavior observed in confined animals and larger, more complex environments substantially reduce the development and expression of such behavior. Studies with this model, including environmental enrichment effects, suggest alterations in cortical-basal ganglia circuitry in the development and expression of repetitive behavior. Considerably more work needs to be done in this area, particularly in modeling the development of aberrant repetitive behavior. As mutant mouse models continue to proliferate, there should be a number of promising genetic models to pursue. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"scopus-33845340757"
"The transcription factor BCL11A defines distinct subsets of midbrain dopaminergic neurons",NA,NA,NA,"Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons are diverse in their projection targets effect on behavior and susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms establishing this diversity during development. We show that the transcription factor BCL11A is expressed in a subset of mDA neurons in the developing and adult murine brain and in a subpopulation of pluripotent-stem-cell-derived human mDA neurons. By combining intersectional labeling and viral-mediated tracing we demonstrate that Bcl11a-expressing mDA neurons form a highly specific subcircuit within the murine dopaminergic system. In the substantia nigra the Bcl11a-expressing mDA subset is particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration upon Î±-synuclein overexpression or oxidative stress. Inactivation of Bcl11a in murine mDA neurons increases this susceptibility further alters the distribution of mDA neurons and results in deficits in skilled motor behavior. In summary BCL11A defines mDA subpopulations with highly distinctive characteristics and is required for establishing and maintaining their normal physiology.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1,NA,"pubmed-34525371"
"Proteomics of autism and Alzheimer's mouse models reveal common alterations in mTOR signaling pathway",NA,NA,NA,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two different neurological disorders that share common clinical features such as language impairment executive functions and motor problems. A genetic convergence has been proposed as well. However the molecular mechanisms of these pathologies are still not well understood. Protein S-nitrosylation (SNO) the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated posttranslational modification targets key proteins implicated in synaptic and neuronal functions. Previously we have shown that NO and SNO are involved in the InsG3680(+/+) ASD and P301S AD mouse models. Here we performed large-scale computational biology analysis of the SNO-proteome followed by biochemical validation to decipher the shared mechanisms between the pathologies. This analysis pointed to the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway as one of the shared molecular mechanisms. Activation of mTOR in the cortex of both mouse models was confirmed by western blots that showed increased phosphorylation of RPS6 a major substrate of mTORC1. Other molecular alterations affected by SNO and shared between the two mouse models such as synaptic-associated processes PKA signaling and cytoskeleton-related processes were also detected. This is the first study to decipher the SNO-related shared mechanisms between SHANK3 and MAPT mutations. Understanding the involvement of SNO in neurological disorders and its intersection between ASD and AD might help developing an effective novel therapy for both neuropathologies.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"pubmed-34535637"
"High-throughput custom capture sequencing identifies novel mutations in coloboma-associated genes: Mutation in DNA-binding domain of retinoic acid receptor beta affects nuclear localization causing ocular coloboma",NA,NA,NA,"Uveal coloboma is a potentially blinding congenital ocular malformation caused by the failure of optic fissure closure during the fifth week of human gestation. We performed custom capture high-throughput screening of 38 known coloboma-associated genes in 66 families. Suspected causative novel variants were identified in TFAP2A and CHD7, as well as two previously reported variants of uncertain significance in RARB and BMP7. The variant in RARB, unlike previously reported disease mutations in the ligand-binding domain, was a missense change in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain predicted to affect the protein's DNA-binding ability. In vitro studies revealed lower steady-state protein levels, reduced transcriptional activity, and incomplete nuclear localization of the mutant RARB protein compared with wild-type. Zebrafish studies showed that human RARB messenger RNA partially reduced the ocular phenotype caused by morpholino knockdown of rarga gene, a zebrafish homolog of human RARB. Our study indicates that sequence alterations in known coloboma genes account for a small percentage of coloboma cases and that mutations in the RARB DNA-binding domain could result in human disease.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"wos-000522632400012"
