"More Than Reels: Cajal-Retzius Cells Become Active","Sanchez-Bellot C., Menendez de la Prida L.","Epilepsy Currents",NA,"Granule Cell Dispersion in Two Mouse Models of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Reeler Mice Is Associated With Changes in Dendritic Orientation and Spine Distribution Puhahn-Schmeiser B, Kleemann T, Jabbarli R, Bock HH, Beck J, Freiman TM [published online ahead of print May 27, 2022]. Hippocampus. 2022. doi:10.1002/hipo.23447 Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients. Glutamate Released by Cajal-Retzius Cells Impacts Specific Hippocampal Circuits and Behaviors Anstötz M, Lee SK, Maccaferri G. Cell Rep. 2022;39(7):110822. doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110822 The impact of Cajal-Retzius cells on the regulation of hippocampal circuits and related behaviors is unresolved. Here, we directly address this issue by impairing the glutamatergic output of Cajal-Retzius cells with the conditional ablation of vGluT2, which is their main vesicular glutamate transporter. Although two distinct conditional knockout lines do not reveal major alterations in hippocampal-layer organization and dendritic length of principal neurons or GABAergic cells, we find parallel deficits in specific hippocampal-dependent behaviors and in their putative underlying microcircuits. First, conditional knockout animals show increased innate anxiety and decreased feedforward GABAergic inhibition on dentate gyrus granule cells. Second, we observe impaired spatial memory processing, which is associated with decreased spine density and reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio of postsynaptic responses at the perforant- and entorhino-hippocampal pathways. We conclude that glutamate synaptically released by Cajal-Retzius cells is critical for the regulation of hippocampal microcircuits and specific types of behaviors. © The Author(s) 2022.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139170604&doi=10.1177%2f15357597221123453&partnerID=40&md5=12754da3ee52b20f9636acd6c572b11d","Instituto Cajal, CSIC, Community of Madrid, Madrid, Spain",2022,"10.1177/15357597221123453","Article","reelin; Article; cajal retzius cell; cell maturation; dendrite; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampus; human; nerve cell; nonhuman; pyramidal nerve cell; seizure susceptibility; temporal lobe epilepsy","scopus-85139170604.pdf","scopus-85139170604","xml_texts/PMC9661624.xml","full_texts/10.1177%2F15357597221123453.txt","full_texts/10.1177%2F15357597221123453.pdf"
"Amelioration of Behavioral Abnormalities in BH4-deficient Mice by Dietary Supplementation of Tyrosine","Kwak S. S., Jeong M., Choi J. H., Kim D., Min H., Yoon Y., Hwang O., Meadows G. G., Joe C. O.","PLoS One",NA,"This study reports an amelioration of abnormal motor behaviors in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-deficient Spr(-/-) mice by the dietary supplementation of tyrosine. Since BH4 is an essential cofactor for the conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine as well as the synthesis of dopamine neurotransmitter within the central nervous system the levels of tyrosine and dopamine were severely reduced in brains of BH4-deficient Spr(-/-) mice. We found that Spr(-/-) mice display variable 'open-field' behaviors impaired motor functions on the 'rotating rod' and dystonic 'hind-limb clasping'. In this study we report that these aberrant motor deficits displayed by Spr(-/-) mice were ameliorated by the therapeutic tyrosine diet for 10 days. This study also suggests that dopamine deficiency in brains of Spr(-/-) mice may not be the biological feature of aberrant motor behaviors associated with BH4 deficiency. Brain levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in Spr(-/-) mice were not substantially increased by the dietary tyrosine therapy. However we found that mTORC1 activity severely suppressed in brains of Spr(-/-) mice fed a normal diet was restored 10 days after feeding the mice the tyrosine diet. The present study proposes that brain mTORC1 signaling pathway is one of the potential targets in understanding abnormal motor behaviors associated with BH4-deficiency.",NA,NA,2013,"10.1371/journal.pone.0060803","Article",NA,"wos-000319109800101.pdf","wos-000319109800101","xml_texts/PMC3618182.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0060803.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0060803.pdf"

L.","Front Cell Dev Biol",NA,"Congenital heart defects occur in almost 80% of patients with CHARGE syndrome a sporadically occurring disease causing craniofacial and other abnormalities due to mutations in the CHD7 gene. Animal models have been generated to mimic CHARGE syndrome; however heart defects are not extensively described in zebrafish disease models of CHARGE using morpholino injections or genetic mutants. Here we describe the co-occurrence of craniofacial abnormalities and heart defects in zebrafish chd7 mutants. These mutant phenotypes are enhanced in the maternal zygotic mutant background. In the chd7 mutant fish we found shortened craniofacial cartilages and extra cartilage formation. Furthermore the length of the ventral aorta is altered in chd7 mutants. Many CHARGE patients have aortic arch anomalies. It should be noted that the aberrant branching of the first branchial arch artery is observed for the first time in chd7 fish mutants. To understand the cellular mechanism of CHARGE syndrome neural crest cells (NCCs) that contribute to craniofacial and cardiovascular tissues are examined using sox10:Cre lineage tracing. In contrast to its function in cranial NCCs we found that the cardiac NCC-derived mural cells along the ventral aorta and aortic arch arteries are not affected in chd7 mutant fish. The chd7 fish mutants we generated recapitulate some of the craniofacial and cardiovascular phenotypes found in CHARGE patients and can be used to further determine the roles of CHD7.",NA,NA,2022,"10.3389/fcell.2022.1030587","Article",NA,"pubmed-36568983.pdf","pubmed-36568983","xml_texts/PMC9768498.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffcell.2022.1030587.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffcell.2022.1030587.pdf"
"Shank3 deficiency alters midbrain GABAergic neuron morphology, GABAergic markers and synaptic activity in primary striatal neurons.","Bačová, Z; Jurkovičová-Tarabová, B; Havránek, T; Mihalj, D; Borbélyová, V; Pirnik, Z; Mravec, B; Ostatníková, D; Bakoš, J","Mol Brain",NA,"Abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission play a role in the pathogenesis of autism, although the mechanisms responsible for alterations in specific brain regions remain unclear. Deficits in social motivation and interactions are core symptoms of autism, likely due to defects in dopaminergic neural pathways. Therefore, investigating the morphology and functional roles of GABAergic neurons within dopaminergic projection areas could elucidate the underlying etiology of autism. The aim of this study was to (1) compare the morphology and arborization of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-positive neurons from the midbrain tegmentum; (2) evaluate synaptic activity in primary neurons from the striatum; and (3) assess GABAergic postsynaptic puncta in the ventral striatum of wild-type (WT) and Shank3-deficient mice. We found a significant decrease in the number of short neurites in GAD positive primary neurons from the midbrain tegmentum in Shank3-deficient mice. The application of a specific blocker of GABA A  receptors (GABA A R) revealed significantly increased frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in Shank3-deficient striatal neurons compared to their WT counterparts. The mean absolute amplitude of the events was significantly higher in striatal neurons from Shank3-deficient compared to WT mice. We also observed a significant reduction in gephyrin/GABA A R γ2 colocalization in the striatum of adult male Shank3-deficient mice. The gene expression of collybistin was significantly lower in the nucleus accumbens while gephyrin and GABA A R γ2 were lower in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male Shank3-deficient compared to WT mice. In conclusion, Shank3 deficiency leads to alterations in GABAergic neurons and impaired GABAergic function in dopaminergic brain areas. These changes may underlie autistic symptoms, and potential interventions modulating GABAergic activity in dopaminergic pathways may represent new treatment modality.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39334399",NA,2024,"10.1186/s13041-024-01145-y","Article","Shank3; Autism spectrum disorder; GABA; Neurite outgrowth; Nucleus accumbens; Ventral tegmental area","pubmed-39334399.pdf","pubmed-39334399","xml_texts/PMC11430545.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13041-024-01145-y.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13041-024-01145-y.pdf"
"Deficiency of autism risk factor ASH1L in prefrontal cortex induces epigenetic aberrations and seizures","Qin L.Williams J. B.Tan T.Liu T.Cao Q.Ma K.Yan Z.","Nat Commun",NA,"ASH1L a histone methyltransferase is identified as a top-ranking risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) however little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying the link of ASH1L haploinsufficiency to ASD. Here we show that ASH1L expression and H3K4me3 level are significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postmortem tissues from ASD patients. Knockdown of Ash1L in PFC of juvenile mice induces the downregulation of risk genes associated with ASD intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. These downregulated genes are enriched in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function and have decreased H3K4me3 occupancy at their promoters. Furthermore Ash1L deficiency in PFC causes the diminished GABAergic inhibition enhanced glutamatergic transmission and elevated PFC pyramidal neuronal excitability which is associated with severe seizures and early mortality. Chemogenetic inhibition of PFC pyramidal neuronal activity combined with the administration of GABA enhancer diazepam rescues PFC synaptic imbalance and seizures but not autistic social deficits or anxiety-like behaviors. These results have revealed the critical role of ASH1L in regulating synaptic gene expression and seizures which provides insights into treatment strategies for ASH1L-associated brain diseases.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119128598&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-021-26972-8&partnerID=40&md5=d42f1bb47a89f4f399f7c8d9da210715","Department of Physiology and Biophysics State University of New York at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Buffalo NY 14203 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physiology and Biophysics State University of New York at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Buffalo NY 14203 USA. zhenyan@buffalo.edu.",2021,"10.1038/s41467-021-26972-8","Article","AnimalsAutism Spectrum Disorder/genetics/metabolismAutistic Disorder/genetics/*metabolismBrain/metabolismDNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolismDisease Models Animal*Epigenesis GeneticFemaleHistone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolismHistones/metabolismHomeostasisHumansIntellectual Disability/geneticsMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLPrefrontal Cortex/*metabolismPyramidal Cells/metabolismRisk FactorsSeizures/*metabolism/physiopathology","pubmed-34782621.pdf","pubmed-34782621","xml_texts/PMC8593046.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-021-26972-8.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-021-26972-8.pdf"

F.","Front Neural Circuits",NA,"Down syndrome (DS) is the leading chromosomal cause of intellectual disability yet the neural substrates of learning and memory deficits remain poorly understood. Here we interrogate neural networks linked to learning and memory in a well-characterized model of DS the Ts65Dn mouse. We report that Ts65Dn mice exhibit exploratory behavior that is not different from littermate wild-type (WT) controls yet behavioral activation of Arc mRNA transcription in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus is altered in Ts65Dn mice. In WT mice a 5 min period of exploration of a novel environment resulted in Arc mRNA transcription in 39% of CA1 neurons. By contrast the same period of exploration resulted in only ~20% of CA1 neurons transcribing Arc mRNA in Ts65Dn mice indicating increased sparsity of the behaviorally induced ensemble. Like WT mice the CA1 pyramidal neurons of Ts65Dn mice reactivated Arc transcription during a second exposure to the same environment 20 min after the first experience but the size of the reactivated ensemble was only ~60% of that in WT mice. After repeated daily exposures there was a further decline in the size of the reactivated ensemble in Ts65Dn and a disruption of reactivation. Together these data demonstrate reduction in the size of the behaviorally induced network that expresses Arc in Ts65Dn mice and disruption of the long-term stability of the ensemble. We propose that these deficits in network formation and stability contribute to cognitive symptoms in DS.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014012822&doi=10.3389%2ffncir.2017.00006&partnerID=40&md5=465f05e244fedfa93c7ca2fc7b6d432d","Solomon H.

Effective treatment for the core symptoms of ASD is still lacking. Behavioral interventions show limited effectiveness, while pharmacotherapy focuses on the amelioration of secondary symptomatology. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide known for its prosocial impact, making it a candidate drug for ASD treatment. Its alleviating effect has been and still is widely researched, but outcomes reported by clinical studies are ambiguous. We examined the effect of daily intranasal OXT (0.8 IU/kg) administration for 4 weeks on the ASD-like phenotype in Shank3-/- adult mice. Animals treated with OXT spent twice as much time interacting with the social partner as early as after 2 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, OXT-treated mice exhibited reduced explorative behavior by 50%, after 4 weeks of treatment, and a 30% reduction in repetitive behavior, 4 weeks after treatment termination. One-fold higher sociability and 30% reduced exploration due to OXT lasted up to 4 weeks following the treatment termination. However, social disinterest was elevated by roughly 10% as well, indicating a form of social ambivalence. Obtained results support the therapeutic potential of intranasally administered OXT in alleviating social shortfalls in a genetic model of ASD. Subsequent research is necessary to elucidate the benefits and risks of the long-term OXT administration, as well as its applicability in other ASD models and the potential treatment effect on social communication, which was not measured in the present study.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38102481","Comenius University Bratislava; Slovak Academy of Sciences; Comenius University Bratislava; Comenius University Bratislava",2023,"10.1038/s41380-023-02330-6","Article","RECEPTOR; BEHAVIORS; DISORDERS","wos-001129526200002.pdf","wos-001129526200002","xml_texts/PMC11116098.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-023-02330-6.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-023-02330-6.pdf"

Mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitated protein revealed that both mutant and wildtype MAB21L1 associate with transcription factors that are known regulators of PAX6 (MEIS1 MEIS2 and PBX1) and with poly(A) RNA binding proteins. Arg51 substitutions reduce the association of wild-type MAB21L1 with TBL1XR1 a component of the NCoR complex.

Our results show: (1) a decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles; (2) reduced active zones; (3) less clathrin immunoreactivity and less presynaptic endings over the hippocampal main dendritic trees; which contrast with (4) a greater number of endosomes and autophagosomes in the presynaptic endings of the tambaleante neurons relative to control ones. Altogether these results show an important role of HERC1 in the regulation of presynaptic membrane dynamics.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088306861&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-68970-8&partnerID=40&md5=4c153dbd1a88914c3f0a254a3d670526","Department of Medical Physiology and Biophysics School of Medicine University of Seville Seville Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physiology Anatomy and Cell Biology University Pablo de Olavide Seville Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physiological Sciences IDIBELL University of Barcelona Barcelona Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Medical Physiology and Biophysics School of Medicine University of Seville Seville Spain. gat@us.es.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physiology Anatomy and Cell Biology University Pablo de Olavide Seville Spain. jaarmbut@upo.es.",2020,"10.1038/s41598-020-68970-8","Article","AnimalsAutophagyCells CulturedHippocampus/physiologyMiceMice KnockoutMutationPresynaptic Terminals/*metabolismPyramidal Cells/metabolismSignal Transduction*Synaptic TransmissionUbiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism","pubmed-32694577.pdf","pubmed-32694577","xml_texts/PMC7374096.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-68970-8.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-68970-8.pdf"

While commercially available antibodies have been widely employed to determine UBE3A localization an extensive analysis and comparison of the performance of different UBE3A antibodies has not been conducted. Here we evaluated the specificities of seven commercial UBE3A antibodies in two of the major experimental models used in UBE3A research mouse and human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells and tissues. We tested these antibodies in their two most common assays immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition we also assessed the ability of these antibodies to capture dynamic spatiotemporal changes of UBE3A by utilizing human cerebral organoid models. Our results reveal that among the seven antibodies tested three antibodies demonstrated substantial nonspecific immunoreactivity.

Different mutations on a single ASD gene contribute to heterogeneity of disease phenotypes, possibly due to functional diversity of generated isoforms. SHANK2, a causative gene in ASD, demonstrates this phenomenon, but there is a scarcity of tools for studying endogenous SHANK2 proteins in an isoform-specific manner. Here, we report a point mutation on SHANK2, which is found in a patient with autism, located on exon of the SHANK2B transcript variant (NM_133266.5), hereby SHANK2B Y29X . This mutation results in an early stop codon and an aberrant splicing event that impacts SHANK2 transcript variants distinctly. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying this mutation, from the patient or isogenic editing, fail to differentiate into functional dopamine (DA) neurons, which can be rescued by genetic correction. Available SMART-Seq single-cell data from human midbrain reveals the abundance of SHANK2B transcript in the ALDH1A1 negative DA neurons. We then show that SHANK2B Y29X  mutation primarily affects SHANK2B expression and ALDH1A1 negative DA neurons in vitro during early neuronal developmental stage. Mice knocked in with the identical mutation exhibit autistic-like behavior, decreased occupancy of ALDH1A1 negative DA neurons and decreased dopamine release in ventral tegmental area (VTA).

"Dynamic patterns of correlated activity in the prefrontal cortex encode information about social behavior","Frost N. A.Haggart A.Sohal V. S.","PLoS Biol",NA,"New technologies make it possible to measure activity from many neurons simultaneously. One approach is to analyze simultaneously recorded neurons individually then group together neurons which increase their activity during similar behaviors into an ""ensemble."" However this notion of an ensemble ignores the ability of neurons to act collectively and encode and transmit information in ways that are not reflected by their individual activity levels. We used microendoscopic GCaMP imaging to measure prefrontal activity while mice were either alone or engaged in social interaction. We developed an approach that combines a neural network classifier and surrogate (shuffled) datasets to characterize how neurons synergistically transmit information about social behavior. Notably unlike optimal linear classifiers a neural network classifier with a single linear hidden layer can discriminate network states which differ solely in patterns of coactivity and not in the activity levels of individual neurons. Using this approach we found that surrogate datasets which preserve behaviorally specific patterns of coactivity (correlations) outperform those which preserve behaviorally driven changes in activity levels but not correlated activity. Thus social behavior elicits increases in correlated activity that are not explained simply by the activity levels of the underlying neurons and prefrontal neurons act collectively to transmit information about socialization via these correlations. Notably this ability of correlated activity to enhance the information transmitted by neuronal ensembles is diminished in mice lacking the autism-associated gene Shank3. These results show that synergy is an important concept for the coding of social behavior which can be disrupted in disease states reveal a specific mechanism underlying this synergy (social behavior increases correlated activity within specific ensembles) and outline methods for studying how neurons within an ensemble can work together to encode information.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105487930&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pbio.3001235&partnerID=40&md5=ebec9c2e1788384cab532dfb9484e1bf","Department of Neurology University of California San Francisco San Francisco California United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Integrative Neuroscience University of California San Francisco San Francisco California United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rWeill Institute for Neurosciences University of California San Francisco San Francisco California United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience University of California San Francisco San Francisco California United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry University of California San Francisco San Francisco California United States of America.",2021,"10.1371/journal.pbio.3001235","Article","Action Potentials/physiologyAnimalsCalcium-Binding Proteins/chemistry/pharmacologyEndoscopesGreen Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry/pharmacologyMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMicrofilament Proteins/metabolismNerve Net/physiologyNerve Tissue Proteins/metabolismNeurons/metabolism/*physiologyPrefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*physiology*Social Behavior","pubmed-33939689.pdf","pubmed-33939689","xml_texts/PMC8118626.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3001235.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3001235.pdf"

The essential clock gene Bmal1 has been associated with human sociability and its missense mutations are identified in ASD. Here we report that global Bmal1 deletion led to significant social impairments excessive stereotyped and repetitive behaviors as well as motor learning disabilities in mice all of which resemble core behavioral deficits in ASD. Furthermore aberrant cell density and immature morphology of dendritic spines were identified in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of Bmal1 knockout (KO) mice. Electrophysiological recordings uncovered enhanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduced firing rates in the PCs of Bmal1 KO mice. Differential expression of ASD- and ataxia-associated genes (Ntng2 Mfrp Nr4a2 Thbs1 Atxn1 and Atxn3) and dysregulated pathways of translational control including hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling were identified in the cerebellum of Bmal1 KO mice. Interestingly the antidiabetic drug metformin reversed mTORC1 hyperactivation and alleviated major behavioral and PC deficits in Bmal1 KO mice. Importantly conditional Bmal1 deletion only in cerebellar PCs was sufficient to recapitulate autistic-like behavioral and cellular changes akin to those identified in Bmal1 KO mice.

However, rodents do not faithfully model key aspects of human brain development, and patient iPSC models are limited by issues with random X-chromosome inactivation.Methods To overcome these challenges and model mosaic PCDH19 expression in vitro, we generated isogenic female human embryonic stem cells with either HA-FLAG-tagged PCDH19 (WT) or homozygous PCDH19 knockout (KO) using genome editing. We then mixed GFP-labeled WT and RFP-labeled KO cells and generated human cortical organoids (hCOs).Results We found that PCDH19 is highly expressed in early (days 20-35) WT neural rosettes where it co-localizes with N-Cadherin in ventricular zone (VZ)-like regions. Mosaic PCE hCOs displayed abnormal cell sorting in the VZ with KO and WT cells completely segregated. This segregation remained robust when WT:KO cells were mixed at 2:1 or 1:2 ratios. PCE hCOs also exhibited altered expression of PCDH19 (in WT cells) and N-Cadherin, and abnormal deep layer neurogenesis. None of these abnormalities were observed in hCOs generated by mixing only WT or only KO (modeling male carrier) cells.Discussion Our results using the mosaic PCE hCO model suggest that PCDH19 plays a critical role in human VZ radial glial organization and early cortical development. This model should offer a key platform for exploring mechanisms underlying PCE-related cortical hyperexcitability and testing of potential precision therapies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38638299","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; Central South University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System",2024,"10.3389/fncel.2024.1339345","Article","PLURIPOTENT STEM-CELLS; X-LINKED INHERITANCE; PCDH19; DIFFERENTIATION; MUTATIONS; MIGRATION","wos-001204737300001.pdf","wos-001204737300001","xml_texts/PMC11024992.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2024.1339345.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2024.1339345.pdf"

"Nuclease-free precise genome editing corrects MECP2 mutations associated with Rett syndrome","Bijlani, S; Pang, KM; Bugga, LV; Rangasamy, S; Narayanan, V; Chatterjee, S","FRONTIERS IN GENOME EDITING",NA,"Rett syndrome is an acquired progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene which encodes a pleiotropic protein that functions as a global transcriptional regulator and a chromatin modifier. Rett syndrome predominantly affects heterozygous females while affected male hemizygotes rarely survive. Gene therapy of Rett syndrome has proven challenging due to a requirement for stringent regulation of expression with either over- or under-expression being toxic. Ectopic expression of MECP2 in conjunction with regulatory miRNA target sequences has achieved some success, but the durability of this approach remains unknown. Here we evaluated a nuclease-free homologous recombination (HR)-based genome editing strategy to correct mutations in the MECP2 gene. The stem cell-derived AAVHSCs have previously been shown to mediate seamless and precise HR-based genome editing. We tested the ability of HR-based genome editing to correct pathogenic mutations in Exons 3 and 4 of the MECP2 gene and restore the wild type sequence while preserving all native genomic regulatory elements associated with MECP2 expression, thus potentially addressing a significant issue in gene therapy for Rett syndrome. Moreover, since the mutations are edited directly at the level of the genome, the corrections are expected to be durable with progeny cells inheriting the edited gene. The AAVHSC MECP2 editing vector was designed to be fully homologous to the target MECP2 region and to insert a promoterless Venus reporter at the end of Exon 4. Evaluation of AAVHSC editing in a panel of Rett cell lines bearing mutations in Exons 3 and 4 demonstrated successful correction and rescue of expression of the edited MECP2 gene. Sequence analysis of edited Rett cells revealed successful and accurate correction of mutations in both Exons 3 and 4 and permitted mapping of HR crossover events. Successful correction was observed only when the mutations were flanked at both the 5 ' and 3 ' ends by crossover events, but not when both crossovers occurred either exclusively upstream or downstream of the mutation. Importantly, we concluded that pathogenic mutations were successfully corrected in every Rett line analyzed, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of HR-based genome editing.",NA,"City of Hope; Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope; Translational Genomics Research Institute",2024,"10.3389/fgeed.2024.1346781","Article","MOUSE MODEL; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR; GENE; SURVIVAL; REVEALS; DISEASE; SITES; METHYLATION; MUTAGENESIS; SEVERITY","wos-001184929400001.pdf","wos-001184929400001","xml_texts/PMC10940404.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffgeed.2024.1346781.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffgeed.2024.1346781.pdf"
"Vorinostat Corrects Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Symptoms in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome","Ding Q.Wu X.Li X.Wang H.","Int J Neuropsychopharmacol",NA,"BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. It is a form of heritable intellectual disability and autism. Despite recent advance in elucidating disease mechanisms there is no efficacious medication. Because de novo drug development is a lengthy process repurposing the existing FDA-approved drugs offers an opportunity to advance clinical intervention for FXS. Our previous study with transcriptome analysis predicts potential therapeutic effects of vorinostat on FXS. METHODS: We analyzed the vorinostat-induced transcriptome changes and confirmed its similarity to that induced by trifluoperazine which was previously shown to correct pathological outcomes associated with FXS. To validate the therapeutic efficacy we examined vorinostat's effect on correcting the key behavioral and cellular symptoms in a mouse model of FXS. RESULTS: We found that vorinostat restores object location memory and passive avoidance memory in the Fmr1 knockout mice. For the non-cognitive behavioral symptoms vorinostat corrected the autism-associated alterations including repetitive behavior and social interaction deficits. In the open field test vorinostat dampened hyperactivity in the center area of the arena. Surprisingly vorinostat did not correct the abnormally elevated protein synthesis in cultured Fmr1 knockout hippocampal neurons suggesting that different aspects of pathological outcomes may respond differently to a specific therapeutic intervention.

It is often characterized, especially in males, by intellectual disability, anxiety, repetitive behavior, social communication deficits, delayed language development, and abnormal sensory processing. Recently, we identified electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers that are conserved between the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO mice) and humans with FXS. Methods: In this report, we evaluate small molecule target engagement utilizing multielectrode array electrophysiology in the Fmr1 KO mouse and in humans with FXS. Neurophysiologic target engagement was evaluated using single doses of the GABAB selective agonist racemic baclofen (RBAC). Results: In Fmr1 KO mice and in humans with FXS, baclofen use was associated with suppression of elevated gamma power and increase in low-frequency power at rest. In the Fmr1 KO mice, a baclofen-associated improvement in auditory chirp synchronization was also noted. Conclusions: Overall, we noted synchronized target engagement of RBAC on resting state electrophysiology, in particular the reduction of aberrant high frequency gamma activity, across species in FXS.

However, the sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the developing prefrontal cortex, which is another brain region highly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have not been investigated. We obtained transcriptome data from RNA sequencing analysis of the prefrontal cortex of male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA or control and reanalyzed. BPA-responsive genes associated with cortical development and social behaviors were selected for confirmation by qRT-PCR analysis. Neuritogenesis of primary cells from the prefrontal cortex of pups prenatally exposed to BPA or control was examined. The social behaviors of the pups were assessed using the two-trial and three-chamber tests. The male-specific impact of the downregulation of a selected BPA-responsive gene (i.e., Sema5a) on cortical development in vivo was interrogated using siRNA-mediated knockdown by an in utero electroporation technique. Genes disrupted by prenatal BPA exposure were associated with ASD and showed sex-specific dysregulation. Sema5a and Slc9a9, which were involved in neuritogenesis and social behaviors, were downregulated only in males, while Anxa2 and Junb, which were also linked to neuritogenesis and social behaviors, were suppressed only in females. Neuritogenesis was increased in males and showed a strong inverse correlation with Sema5a and Slc9a9 expression levels, whereas, in the females, neuritogenesis was decreased and correlated with Anxa2 and Junb levels. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sema5a in males also impaired cortical development in utero. Consistent with Anxa2 and Junb downregulations, deficits in social novelty were observed only in female offspring but not in males. This is the first study to show that prenatal BPA exposure dysregulated the expression of ASD-related genes and functions, including cortical neuritogenesis and development and social behaviors, in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that, besides the hippocampus, BPA could also exert its adverse effects through sex-specific molecular mechanisms in the offspring's prefrontal cortex, which in turn would lead to sex differences in ASD-related neuropathology and clinical manifestations, which deserves further investigation.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38750585",NA,2024,"10.1186/s13293-024-00614-2","Article","Autism spectrum disorder; Bisphenol A; Cortical development; Endocrine-disrupting chemical; Micro/nanoplastics; Neuritogenesis; Neuronal migration; Prefrontal cortex; Sex difference; Social behaviors","pubmed-38750585.pdf","pubmed-38750585","xml_texts/PMC11094985.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13293-024-00614-2.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13293-024-00614-2.pdf"

K.Potters J. W.Oostra B. A.De Zeeuw C. I.","Genes Brain Behav",NA,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. Patients with FXS do not only suffer from cognitive problems but also from abnormalities/deficits in procedural memory formation. It has been proposed that a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to altered long-term plasticity by deregulation of various translational processes at the synapses and that part of these impairments might be rescued by the inhibition of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We recently developed the Erasmus Ladder which allows us to test without any invasive approaches simultaneously both procedural memory formation and avoidance behavior during unperturbed and perturbed locomotion in mice. Here we investigated the impact of a potent and selective mGluR5 inhibitor (Fenobam) on the behavior of Fmr1 KO mice during the Erasmus Ladder task. Fmr1 KO mice showed deficits in associative motor learning as well as avoidance behavior both of which were rescued by intraperitoneal administration of Fenobam. While the Fmr1 KO mice did benefit from the treatment control littermates suffered from a significant negative side effect in that their motor learning skills but not their avoidance behavior were significantly affected. On the basis of these studies in the FXS animal model it may be worthwhile to investigate the effects of mGluR inhibitors on both the cognitive functions and procedural skills in FXS patients.

S., Tiwari V., Lakshmi B. J., Thakur S. S., Kumar S.","Front Mol Neurosci",NA,"WDR13 expresses from the X chromosome and has a highly conserved coding sequence. There have been multiple associations of WDR13 with memory. However its detailed function in context of brain and behavior remains unknown. We characterized the behavioral phenotype of 2 month old male mice lacking the homolog of WDR13 gene (Wdr13 (-/0)). Taking cue from analysis of its expression in the brain we chose hippocampus for molecular studies to delineate its function. Wdr13 (-/0) mice spent less time in the central area of the open field test (OFT) and with the novel object in novel object recognition test (NOR) as compared to the wild-type. However these mice didn't show any significant changes in total time spent in arms or in frequency of arm entries in elevated plus maze (EPM). In the absence of Wdr13 there was a significant upregulation of synaptic proteins viz. SYN1 RAB3A CAMK2A etc. accompanied with increased spine density of hippocampal CA1 neurons and better spatial memory in mice as measured by increased time spent in the target quadrant of Morris water maze (MWM) during probe test. Parallel study from our lab has established c-JUN ER α/β and HDAC 137 as interacting partners of WDR13. WDR13 represses transcription from AP1 (c-JUN responsive) and Estrogen Receptor Element (ERE) promoters. We hypothesized that absence of Wdr13 would result in de-regulated expression of a number of genes including multiple synaptic genes leading to the observed phenotype.

"Cell type-specific role of RNA nuclease SMG6 in neurogenesis","Guerra G.M., May D., Kroll T., Koch P., Groth M., Wang Z.-Q., Li T.-L., Grigaravičius P.","Cells",NA,"SMG6 is an endonuclease, which cleaves mRNAs during nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), thereby regulating gene expression and controling mRNA quality. SMG6 has been shown as a differentiation license factor of totipotent embryonic stem cells. To investigate whether it controls the differentiation of lineage-specific pluripotent progenitor cells, we inactivated Smg6 in murine embryonic neural stem cells. Nestin-Cre-mediated deletion of Smg6 in mouse neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) caused perinatal lethality. Mutant mice brains showed normal structure at E14.5 but great reduction of the cortical NPCs and late-born cortical neurons during later stages of neurogenesis (i.e., E18.5). Smg6 inactivation led to dramatic cell death in ganglionic eminence (GE) and a reduction of interneurons at E14.5. Interestingly, neurosphere assays showed self-renewal defects specifically in interneuron progenitors but not in cortical NPCs. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the interneuron differentiation regulators Dlx1 and Dlx2 were reduced after Smg6 deletion. Intriguingly, when Smg6 was deleted specifically in cortical and hippocampal progenitors, the mutant mice were viable and showed normal size and architecture of the cortex at E18.5. Thus, SMG6 regulates cell fate in a cell type-specific manner and is more important for neuroprogenitors originating from the GE than for progenitors from the cortex. © 2021 by the authors.

"Reduction in Tcf7l2 expression decreases diabetic susceptibility in mice","Yang H.Li Q.Lee J. H.Shu Y.","Int J Biol Sci",NA,"OBJECTIVE: The WNT signaling pathway effector gene TCF7L2 has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However it remains unclear how this gene affects diabetic pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of Tcf7l2 haploinsufficiency on metabolic phenotypes in mice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tcf7l2 knockout (Tcf7l⁻/⁻) mice were generated. Because of the early mortality of Tcf7l2⁻/⁻ mice we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of heterozygous Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice in comparison to the wild-type controls. The mice were fed a normal chow diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks. RESULTS: The Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice showed significant differences from the wild-type mice with regards to body weight fasting glucose and insulin levels. Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice displayed improved glucose tolerance. In the liver of Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice fed on the HFD reduced lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride levels were observed when compared with those of wild-type mice. Furthermore the Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice fed on the HFD exhibited decreased peripheral fat deposition. Immunohistochemistry in mouse pancreatic islets showed that endogenous expression of Tcf7l2 was upregulated in the wild-type mice but not in the Tcf7l2⁺/⁻ mice after feeding with the HFD. However the haploinsufficiency of Tcf7l2 in mouse pancreatic islets resulted in little changes in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased expression of Tcf7l2 confers reduction of diabetic susceptibility in mice via regulation on the metabolism of glucose and lipid.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863753084&doi=10.7150%2fijbs.4568&partnerID=40&md5=c29dabe3ad1b3ac5b6dcbc889ee016e1","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences School of Pharmacy University of Maryland Baltimore Maryland 21201 USA.",2012,"10.7150/ijbs.4568","Article","AnimalsBlood Glucose/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus/chemically induced/*metabolism/prevention & controlDiet High-Fat/*adverse effectsIslets of Langerhans/metabolismMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutTranscription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolismTcf7l2diabetesgluconeogenesisglucose tolerancehepatic steatosis.high fat diet","pubmed-22719219.pdf","pubmed-22719219","xml_texts/PMC3372883.xml","full_texts/10.7150%2Fijbs.4568.txt","full_texts/10.7150%2Fijbs.4568.pdf"

The mouse and human genomes each have six Dlx genes organized into three convergently transcribed bigene clusters (Dlx1/2 Dlx3/4 and Dlx5/6) with cis-regulatory elements (CREs) located in the intergenic region of each cluster. Amongst these the I56i and I12b enhancers from the Dlx1/2 and Dlx5/6 locus respectively are active in the developing forebrain. I56i is also a binding site for GTF2I a transcription factor whose function is associated with increased sociability and Williams-Beuren syndrome. In determining the regulatory roles of these CREs on forebrain development we have generated mutant mouse-lines where Dlx forebrain intergenic enhancers have been deleted (I56i((-/-)) I12b((-/-))). Loss of Dlx intergenic enhancers impairs expression of Dlx genes as well as some of their downstream targets or associated genes including Gad2 and Evf2. The loss of the I56i enhancer resulted in a transient decrease in GABA(+) cells in the developing forebrain. The intergenic enhancer mutants also demonstrate increased sociability and learning deficits in a fear conditioning test.

Despite extensive studies, however, the underlying pathogenic mechanism still remains elusive. In the present study, we identified a homozygous mutation in the intron 1 of Wnt1 via large-scale screening of ASD risk/causative genes and verified that this mutation created a new splicing donor site in the intron 1, and consequently, a decrease of WNT1 expression. Interestingly, humanized rat models harboring this mutation exhibited robust ASD-like behaviors including impaired ultrasonic vocalization (USV), decreased social interactions, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, in the substantia nigra compacta (SNpc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mutant rats, dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons were dramatically lost, together with a comparable decrease in striatal DAergic fibers. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that the decreased DAergic neurons in these midbrain areas might attribute to a shift of the boundary of the local pool of progenitor cells from the hypothalamic floor plate to the midbrain floor plate during the early embryonic stage. Moreover, treatments of mutant rats with levodopa could attenuate the impaired USV and social interactions almost completely, but not the restricted and repetitive behaviors. Our results for the first time documented that the developmental loss of DAergic neurons in the midbrain underlies the pathogenesis of ASD, and that the abnormal progenitor cell patterning is a cellular underpinning for this developmental DAergic neuronal loss. Importantly, the effective dopamine therapy suggests a translational significance in the treatment of ASD.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37658228",NA,2023,"10.1038/s41380-023-02223-8","Article",NA,"pubmed-37658228.pdf","pubmed-37658228","xml_texts/PMC10730402.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-023-02223-8.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-023-02223-8.pdf"

Breeding histologic and mTOR signaling data were obtained at multiple time points in KO and wild type (WT) mice fed a control or rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) diet. KO mice showed an earlier decline in ovarian reserve than WT mice with an increased proportion of activated follicles. mTOR and phosphorylated 56 kinase (p-S6K) levels a measure of downstream mTOR signaling were elevated in the KO ovaries. Rapamycin blocked these effects in KO mice and increased the primordial follicle pool and age of last litter in WT mice. Our data demonstrates an early decline in reproductive capacity in Fmr1 KO mice and proposes that premature recruitment of the primordial pool via altered mTOR signaling may be the mechanism.

"NMDA Receptors Regulate the Development of Neuronal Intrinsic Excitability through Cell-Autonomous Mechanisms","Hou G., Zhang Z. W.","Front Cell Neurosci",NA,"Maturation of neuronal and synaptic functions during early life is essential for the development of neuronal circuits and behaviors. In newborns synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses is primarily mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and NMDAR-mediated signaling plays an important role in synaptic maturation. Concomitant with synapse development the intrinsic properties of neurons undergo dramatic changes during early life. However little is known about the role of NMDARs in the development of intrinsic excitability. By using mosaic deletion of the obligatory GluN1 subunit of NMDARs in the thalamus of newborn mice we showed that NMDARs regulate neuronal excitability during postnatal development. Compared with neighboring control neurons neurons lacking NMDARs exhibit hyperexcitability and this effect is present throughout early life. Morphological analyses show that thalamic neurons without NMDARs have smaller soma size and fewer dendritic branches. Deletion of NMDARs causes a reduction of hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channel function in thalamic neurons and pharmacologically blocking HCN channels in wild type neurons mimics the effects of GluN1 deletion on intrinsic excitability. Deletion of GluN1 down-regulated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in thalamic neurons and mosaic deletion of mTOR recapitulated the effects of GluN1 deletion. Our results demonstrate that NMDARs regulate intrinsic excitability and morphology of thalamic neurons through cell autonomous mechanisms that implicate mTOR signaling.",NA,NA,2017,"10.3389/fncel.2017.00353","Article",NA,"pubmed-29163060.pdf","pubmed-29163060","xml_texts/PMC5674002.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2017.00353.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2017.00353.pdf"
"A behavioral evaluation of sex differences in a mouse model of severe neuronal migration disorder","Truong D. T.Bonet A.Rendall A. R.Rosen G. D.Fitch R. H.","Plos one",NA,"Disruption of neuronal migration in humans is associated with a wide range of behavioral and cognitive outcomes including severe intellectual disability language impairment and social dysfunction. Furthermore malformations of cortical development have been observed in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism and dyslexia) where boys are much more commonly diagnosed than girls (estimates around 4 to 1). The use of rodent models provides an excellent means to examine how sex may modulate behavioral outcomes in the presence of comparable abnormal neuroanatomical presentations. Initially characterized by Rosen et al. 2012 the BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J mouse mutant exhibits a highly penetrant neuroanatomical phenotype that consists of bilateral midline subcortical nodular heterotopia with partial callosal agenesis. In the current study we confirm our initial findings of a severe impairment in rapid auditory processing in affected male mice. We also report that BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J (mutant) female mice show no sparing of rapid auditory processing and in fact show deficits similar to mutant males.

"Influence of sex and genetic background on anxiety-related and stress-induced behaviour of prodynorphin-deficient mice","Kastenberger I.Lutsch C.Herzog H.Schwarzer C.","Plos one",NA,"The role of dynorphin/kappa opioid receptors in epilepsy and addiction are well accepted but their function in emotional control is not yet fully understood. Data obtained from different strains of prodynorphin (Pdyn)- and kappa opioid receptor (KOP)-deficient mice do not provide a consistent picture of the functions of Dyn/KOP in anxiety suggesting the influence of testing conditions and/or genetic background. Therefore we investigated the behaviour and neurochemistry of male and female Pdyn KO mice on the balb/c and C57Bl/6N background. Consistent with our results obtained from male mice on the C57bl/6N background we observed a less anxious phenotype in the elevated plus maze open-field and light-dark test in male mice on the balb/c background. Female mice on the balb/c background also displayed less anxiety like behaviour; however these data reflect high trait anxiety and inter-individual differences. In contrast female mice on the C57Bl/6N background displayed low trait anxiety and a paradigm-dependent reduction of anxiety. No differences were observed in the forced swim test while balb/c Pdyn KO mice displayed prolonged immobility in the tail suspension test. In line with our previous results we observed reduced CRH mRNA in the central amygdala in all groups of mice. In contrast the recently observed CRH mRNA reduction in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus appears restricted to male but not female mice. Our data support previous data suggesting a pronounced impact of endogenous prodynorphin-derived peptides on anxiety. Moreover our data support the idea that the less anxious phenotype manifests only at elevated stress levels.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859029475&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0034251&partnerID=40&md5=3e0e1e9d84bc12f28e6363c9633733ba","Department of Pharmacology Innsbruck Medical University Innsbruck Austria.",2012,"10.1371/journal.pone.0034251","Article","AnimalsAnxiety/*geneticsBehavior AnimalEnkephalins/*geneticsEpigenesis GeneticFemaleIn Situ HybridizationMaleMaze LearningMiceMice Inbred BALB CMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutModels GeneticPeptides/chemistryPhenotypeProtein Precursors/*geneticsStress Psychological/*geneticsSwimming","pubmed-22479578.pdf","pubmed-22479578","xml_texts/PMC3315500.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034251.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034251.pdf"

Affected individuals present with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and speech and motor deficits.

In this study, we describe a novel presynaptic mechanism of cis-regulated oligomerization of adhesion molecules that controls synaptogenesis. We identified synaptic adhesion-like molecule 1 (SALM1) as a constituent of the proposed presynaptic Munc18/CASK/Mint1/Lin7b organizer complex. SALM1 preferentially localized to presynaptic compartments of excitatory hippocampal neurons. SALM1 depletion in excitatory hippocampal primary neurons impaired Neurexin1β- and Neuroligin1-mediated excitatory synaptogenesis and reduced synaptic vesicle clustering, synaptic transmission, and synaptic vesicle release. SALM1 promoted Neurexin1β clustering in an F-actin- and PIP2-dependent manner. Two basic residues in SALM1's juxtamembrane polybasic domain are essential for this clustering. Together, these data show that SALM1 is a presynaptic organizer of synapse development by promoting F-actin/PIP2-dependent clustering of Neurexin. © 2019 The Authors.

Numerous studies have suggested that the loss or mutation of PTEN plays a critical role in HCC tumorigenesis through the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling axis. The homozygous knockout of PTEN in the livers of mice results in the accumulation of fat (steatosis), inflammation, fibrosis, and eventually progression to HCC. This phenotype bears a striking similarity to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is thought to occupy an intermediate stage between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fibrosis, and HCC. The molecular and physiological phenotypes that manifest during the transition to HCC suggest that molecular imaging could provide a non-invasive screening platform to identify the hallmarks of HCC initiation prior to the presentation of clinical disease. We have carried out longitudinal imaging studies on the liver-specific PTEN knockout mouse model using CT, MRI, and multi-tracer PET to interrogate liver size, steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. In male PTEN knockout mice, significant steatosis was observed as early as 3 months using both magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and computed tomography (CT). Enhanced uptake of the apoptosis tracer  18 F-TBD was also observed in the livers of male PTEN homozygous knockout mice between 3 and 4 months of age relative to heterozygous knockout controls. Liver uptake of the inflammation tracer [ 18 F]4FN remained relatively low and constant over 7 months in male PTEN homozygous knockout mice, suggesting the suppression of high-energy ROS/RNS with PTEN deletion relative to heterozygous males where the [ 18 F]4FN liver uptake was elevated at early and late time points. All male PTEN homozygous mice developed HCC lesions by month 10. In contrast to the male cohort, only 20% (2 out of 10) of female PTEN homozygous knockout mice developed HCC lesions by month 10. Steatosis was significantly less pronounced in the female PTEN homozygous knockout mice relative to males and could not accurately predict the eventual occurrence of HCC. As with the males, the [ 18 F]4FN uptake in female PTEN homozygous knockout mice was low and constant throughout the time course. The liver uptake of  18 F-TBD at 3 and 4.5 months was higher in the two female PTEN knockout mice that would eventually develop HCC and was the most predictive imaging biomarker for HCC in the female cohort. These studies demonstrate the diagnostic and prognostic role of multi-modal imaging in HCC mouse models and provide compelling evidence that disease progression in the PTEN knockout model is highly dependent on gender.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37568603",NA,2023,"10.3390/cancers15153787","Article","HCC; MRS; NALFD; NASH; PET; apoptosis; inflammation","pubmed-37568603.pdf","pubmed-37568603","xml_texts/PMC10417617.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fcancers15153787.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fcancers15153787.pdf"

Mutations in MEF2 pathways are implicated in autism spectrum disorders which include cerebellar dysfunction. Here we test the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD requires postsynaptic activation of MEF2. Knockdown of MEF2D produces suppression of the transcription-dependent late phase of LTD in cultured Purkinje cells. The late phase of LTD is also completely blocked in Purkinje cells derived from MEF2A+MEF2D null mice and rescued with plasmids that drive expression of MEF2D but not phosphatase-resistant mutant MEF2D S444D. Wild-type Purkinje cells transfected with a constitutively active form of MEF2 show no alterations of synaptic strength. Thus postsynaptic activation of MEF2 by S444 dephosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for the late phase of cerebellar LTD.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060348515&doi=10.1016%2fj.celrep.2019.01.004&partnerID=40&md5=f5fd2a44282464aa05c09ddd893ba0fc","Department of Neurobiology Harvard Medical School 220 Longwood Avenue Boston MA 02115 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rThe Solomon H.

To assess whether Calstabin2 is involved in age-related heart dysfunction we studied Calstabin2 knockout (KO) and control wild-type (WT) mice. We found a significant association between deletion of Calstabin2 and cardiac aging. Indeed aged Calstabin2 KO mice exhibited a markedly impaired cardiac function compared with WT littermates. Calstabin2 deletion resulted also in increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p19 augmented cardiac fibrosis cell death and shorter telomeres.

The DLX5/6 locus is regulated by FoxP2 a gene involved in language evolution and has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and mental retardation. Targeted inactivation of Dlx5/6 in mouse GABAergic neurons (Dlx5/6VgatCre mice) results in behavioral and metabolic phenotypes notably increasing lifespan by 33%. Here we show that Dlx5/6VgatCre mice present a hyper-vocalization and hyper-socialization phenotype. While only 7% of control mice emitted more than 700 vocalizations/10 min 30% and 56% of heterozygous or homozygous Dlx5/6VgatCre mice emitted more than 700 and up to 1400 calls/10 min with a higher proportion of complex and modulated calls. Hyper-vocalizing animals were more sociable: the time spent in dynamic interactions with an unknown visitor was more than doubled compared to low-vocalizing individuals. The characters affected by Dlx5/6 in the mouse (sociability vocalization skull and brain shape…) overlap those affected in the ""domestication syndrome"". We therefore explored the possibility that DLX5/6 played a role in human evolution and ""self-domestication"" comparing DLX5/6 genomic regions from Neanderthal and modern humans. We identified an introgressed Neanderthal haplotype (DLX5/6-N-Haplotype) present in 12.6% of European individuals that covers DLX5/6 coding and regulatory sequences.

Individuals with Rett syndrome display developmental regression at an early age and develop a range of motor auditory cognitive and social impairments. Several studies have successfully modeled some aspects of dysfunction and Rett syndrome-like phenotypes in transgenic mouse and rat models bearing mutations in the MECP2 gene. Here we sought to extend these findings and characterize skilled learning a more complex behavior known to be altered in Rett syndrome. METHODS: We evaluated the acquisition and performance of auditory and motor function on two complex tasks in heterozygous female Mecp2 rats. Animals were trained to perform a speech discrimination task or a skilled forelimb reaching task. RESULTS: Our results reveal that Mecp2 rats display slower acquisition and reduced performance on an auditory discrimination task than wild-type (WT) littermates. Similarly Mecp2 rats exhibit impaired learning rates and worse performance on a skilled forelimb motor task compared to WT.

"Developmental and maintenance defects in Rett syndrome neurons identified by a new mouse staging system in vitro","Baj G.Patrizio A.Montalbano A.Sciancalepore M.Tongiorgi E.","Front Cell Neurosci",NA,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MECP2 gene. RTT brains display decreased neuronal size and dendritic arborization possibly caused by either a developmental failure or a deficit in the maintenance of dendritic arbor structure. To distinguish between these two hypotheses the development of Mecp2-knockout mouse hippocampal neurons was analyzed in vitro. Since a staging system for the in vitro development of mouse neurons was lacking mouse and rat hippocampal neurons development was compared between 1-15 days in vitro (DIV) leading to a 6-stage model for both species.

RAI1 is a transcriptional regulator with a pan-neural expression pattern and hundreds of downstream targets. The mechanisms linking neural  Rai1  to body weight regulation remain unclear. Here we find that hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream signalling are disrupted in SMS ( Rai1 +/- ) mice. Selective  Rai1  loss from all BDNF-producing cells or from BDNF-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) induced obesity in mice. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that  Rai1  ablation decreased the intrinsic excitability of PVH BDNF  neurons. Chronic treatment of SMS mice with LM22A-4 engages neurotrophin downstream signalling and delayed obesity onset. This treatment also partially rescued disrupted lipid profiles, insulin intolerance, and stereotypical repetitive behaviour in SMS mice. These data argue that RAI1 regulates body weight and metabolic function through hypothalamic BDNF-producing neurons and that targeting neurotrophin downstream signalling might improve associated SMS phenotypes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37956053",NA,2023,"10.7554/elife.90333","Article","brain-derived neurotrophic factor; mouse; neuroscience; obesity; paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus; retinoic acid induced 1","pubmed-37956053.pdf","pubmed-37956053","xml_texts/PMC10642964.xml","full_texts/10.7554%2Felife.90333.txt","full_texts/10.7554%2Felife.90333.pdf"

Y.","Sci Rep",NA,"Inhibitory interneurons are essential for proper brain development and function. Dysfunction of interneurons is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). We have previously shown that Arid1b haploinsufficiency interferes with interneuron development and leads to social cognitive and emotional impairments consistent with ASD and ID. It is unclear however whether interneurons play a major role for the behavioral deficits in Arid1b haploinsufficiency. Furthermore it is critical to determine which interneuron subtypes contribute to distinct behavioral phenotypes. In the present study we generated Arid1b haploinsufficient mice in which a copy of the Arid1b gene is deleted in either parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST) interneurons and examined their ASD- and ID-like behaviors. We found that Arid1b haploinsufficiency in PV or SST interneurons resulted in distinct features that do not overlap with one another. Arid1b haploinsufficiency in PV neurons contributed to social and emotional impairments while the gene deletion in the SST population caused stereotypies as well as learning and memory dysfunction. These findings demonstrate a critical role of interneurons in Arid1b haploinsufficient pathology and suggest that PV and SST interneurons may have distinct roles in modulating neurological phenotypes in Arid1b haploinsufficiency-induced ASD and ID.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084431535&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-64066-5&partnerID=40&md5=54e20c187861646ad69e8b9b95a9a8a2","Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience University of Nebraska Medical Center Omaha NE 68198 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLaboratory of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology College of Veterinary Medicine Chungbuk National University Cheongju 28644 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biological Sciences Kent State University Kent OH 44242 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biological Sciences Kent State University Kent OH 44242 USA. wkim2@kent.edu.",2020,"10.1038/s41598-020-64066-5","Article","AnimalsAnxiety/complicationsAutism Spectrum Disorder/complications/*genetics/pathology/physiopathologyBehavior AnimalDepression/complicationsGene Expression Regulation*HaploinsufficiencyIntellectual Disability/complications/*genetics/pathology/physiopathologyInterneurons/*metabolism/pathologyMemoryParvalbumins/*metabolismPhenotypeSocial BehaviorSomatostatin/*metabolismSpatial LearningTranscription Factors/*genetics","pubmed-32398858.pdf","pubmed-32398858","xml_texts/PMC7217886.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-64066-5.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-64066-5.pdf"

We sought to test the association of gut microbiota and mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling with cow's milk allergy (CMA)-induced autism pathogenesis. METHODS: Mice were sensitized intragastrically with whey protein containing cholera toxin before sensitization on intraperitoneal injection with whey-containing alum followed by intragastric allergen challenge to induce experimental CMA. The food allergic immune responses ASD-like behavioral tests and changes in the mTOR signaling pathway and gut microbial community structure were performed. RESULTS: CMA mice showed autism-like behavioral abnormalities and several distinct biomarkers. These include increased levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in the hypothalamus; c-Fos were predominantly located in the region of the lateral orbital prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not ventral; decreased serotonin 1A in amygdala and PFC. CMA mice exhibited a specific microbiota signature characterized by coordinate changes in the abundance of taxa of several bacterial genera including the Lactobacillus. Interestingly the changes were accompanied by promoted mTOR signaling in the brain of CMA mice.

M.","Dis Model Mech",NA,"Technology has led to rapid progress in the identification of genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) but our functional understanding of the causative genes is lagging. Here we show that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex is one of the most over-represented cellular components disrupted in ID. We investigated the role of individual subunits of this large protein complex using targeted RNA interference in post-mitotic memory-forming neurons of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Knockdown flies were tested for defects in MB morphology short-term memory and long-term memory. Using this approach we identified distinct roles for individual subunits of the Drosophila SWI/SNF complex. Bap60 Snr1 and E(y)3 are required for pruning of the MBγ neurons during pupal morphogenesis while Brm and Osa are required for survival of MBγ axons during ageing. We used the courtship conditioning assay to test the effect of MB-specific SWI/SNF knockdown on short- and long-term memory. Several subunits including Brm Bap60 Snr1 and E(y)3 were required in the MB for both short- and long-term memory. In contrast Osa knockdown only reduced long-term memory.

CaM is frequently trimethylated at Lys-115 however the role of CaM methylation in vertebrates has not been studied. CaM KMT was found to be homozygously deleted in the 2P21 deletion syndrome that includes 4 genes. These patients present with cystinuria severe intellectual disabilities hypotonia mitochondrial disease and facial dysmorphism. Two siblings with deletion of three of the genes included in the 2P21 deletion syndrome presented with cystinuria hypotonia a mild/moderate mental retardation and a respiratory chain complex IV deficiency. To be able to attribute the functional significance of the methylation of CaM in the mouse and the contribution of CaM KMT to the clinical presentation of the 2p21deletion patients we produced a mouse model lacking only CaM KMT with deletion borders as in the human 2p21deletion syndrome. No compensatory activity for CaM methylation was found. Impairment of complexes I and IV and less significantly III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was more pronounced in the brain than in muscle. CaM KMT is essential for normal body growth and somatosensory development as well as for the proper functioning of the adult mouse brain. Developmental delay was demonstrated for somatosensory function and for complex behavior which involved both basal motor function and motivation. The mutant mice also had deficits in motor learning complex coordination and learning of aversive stimuli. The mouse model contributes to the evaluation of the role of methylated CaM. CaM methylation appears to have a role in growth muscle strength somatosensory development and brain function. The current study has clinical implications for human patients.

Cortical GABAergic neurons play a pivotal role for the generation of synchronized cortical network oscillations. Imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms underlies many neuropsychiatric disorders and is correlated with abnormalities in oscillatory activity, especially in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz). We investigated the functional changes in cortical network activity in response to developmentally reduced inhibition in the adult mouse barrel cortex (BC). We used a mouse model that displays similar to 50% fewer cortical interneurons due to the loss of Rac1 protein from Nkx2.1/Cre-expressing cells [Rac1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice], to examine how this developmental loss of cortical interneurons may affect basal synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, spontaneous activity, and neuronal oscillations in the adult BC. The decrease in the number of interneurons increased basal synaptic transmission, as examined by recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from layer II networks in the Rac1 cKO mouse cortex, decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to tetanic stimulation but did not alter the pair-pulse ratio (PPR). Furthermore, under spontaneous recording conditions, Rac1 cKO brain slices exhibit enhanced sensitivity and susceptibility to emergent spontaneous activity. We also find that this developmental decrease in the number of cortical interneurons results in local neuronal networks with alterations in neuronal oscillations, exhibiting decreased power in low frequencies (delta, theta, alpha) and gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz) with an extra aberrant peak in high gamma frequency range (80-150 Hz).

Phospholamban (PLN) is a prominent regulator of SERCA2 with an established role in myocardial Ca2+-cycling. Our findings suggest that the role of PLN extends beyond the cardiovascular system to impact brain function.

Q.","Nucleic Acids Res",NA,"NBS1 is a critical component of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex which regulates ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Mutations in NBS1 cause the human genomic instability syndrome Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) of which neuronal deficits including microcephaly and intellectual disability are classical hallmarks. Given its function in the DDR to ensure proper proliferation and prevent death of replicating cells NBS1 is essential for life. Here we show that unexpectedly Nbs1 deletion is dispensable for postmitotic neurons but compromises their arborization and migration due to dysregulated Notch signaling. We find that Nbs1 interacts with NICD-RBPJ the effector of Notch signaling and inhibits Notch activity. Genetic ablation or pharmaceutical inhibition of Notch signaling rescues the maturation and migration defects of Nbs1-deficient neurons in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of Notch by Nbs1 deletion is independent of the key DDR downstream effector p53 and inactivation of each MRN component produces a different pattern of Notch activity and distinct neuronal defects. These data indicate that neuronal defects and aberrant Notch activity in Nbs1-deficient cells are unlikely to be a direct consequence of loss of MRN-mediated DDR function.

"Individual Copy Number of Ribosomal Genes as a Factor of Mental Retardation and Autism Risk and Severity","Porokhovnik L.","Cells",NA,"Autism is a complex multifactorial developmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication and restricted interests often followed by mental retardation. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are caused by defects in miscellaneous molecular mechanisms many of which remain unclear. But a considerable part of the known pathways converges on protein synthesis or degradation processes at different stages in the dendrites laying the foundation for a concept of disturbed ""translational homeostasis"" or ""proteostasis"" in autism. The protein synthesis is conducted on ribosomes cellular organelles consisting from a complex of riboproteins and a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) framework. The rRNA is encoded by ribosomal genes (RG) existing in multiple copies in the genome. The more copies of RG that are contained in the genome the higher is the peak (maximum possible) ribosome abundance in the cell. A hypothesis is proposed that the RG copy number through determining the quantity of ribosomes available in the dendrites modulates the level of local dendritic translation and thus is a factor of risk and severity of a series of neuropsychiatric disorders caused by aberrant dendritic translation. A carrier of very low copy number of ribosomal genes is expected to have a milder form of ASD than a subject with the same epigenetic and genetic background but a higher ribosomal gene dosage. Various ways of evaluation and testing the hypothesis on clinical material and animal models are suggested.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086524185&doi=10.3390%2fcells8101151&partnerID=40&md5=a4f8c87b8349892fb8a878dda164a2ec","Research Centre for Medical Genetics 1 Moskvorechie str.

"Hyperactivity perseveration and increased responding during attentional rule acquisition in the Fragile X mouse model","Kramvis I.Mansvelder H. D.Loos M.Meredith R.","Front Behav Neurosci",NA,"Attentional deficits and executive function impairments are common to many neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual disability and autism including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the knockout mouse model for FXS significant changes in synaptic plasticity and connectivity are found in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-a prominent region for attentional processing and executive control. Given these alterations in PFC synaptic function we tested whether adult Fragile X knockout mice exhibited corresponding impairments in inhibitory control perseveration and sustained attention. Furthermore we investigated individual performance during attentional rule acquisition. Using the 5-choice serial reaction time task our results show no impairments in inhibitory control and sustained attention. Fragile X knockout mice exhibited enhanced levels of correct and incorrect responding as well as perseveration of responding during initial phases of rule acquisition that normalized with training. For both knockout and wild type mice pharmacological attenuation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 signaling did not affect response accuracy but reduced impulsive responses and increased omission errors. Upon rule reversal Fragile X knockout mice made more correct and incorrect responses similar to the initial phases of rule acquisition. Analogous to heightened activity upon novel rule acquisition Fragile X knockout mice were transiently hyperactive in both a novel open field (OF) arena and novel home cage. Hyperactivity ceased with familiarization to the environment. Our findings demonstrate normal inhibitory control and sustained attention but heightened perseveration responding and hyperactivity during novel rule acquisition and during exposure to novel environments in Fragile X knockout mice. We therefore provide evidence for subtle but significant differences in the processing of novel stimuli in the mouse model for the FXS.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84888342073&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2013.00172&partnerID=40&md5=7289178283b8ef7eb33754bf09cf26d9","Department of Integrative Neurophysiology Centre for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research VU University Amsterdam Amsterdam Netherlands ; Sylics (Synaptologics BV) Amsterdam Netherlands.",2013,"10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00172","Article","5-choice serial reaction time taskFragile XMpepattentionhyperactivitylearningperseverationprefrontal cortex","pubmed-24312033.pdf","pubmed-24312033","xml_texts/PMC3836024.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2013.00172.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2013.00172.pdf"

M.Vermudez S. A. D.Lindsley C. W.Niswender C. M.Gogliotti R. G.","Neurotherapeutics",NA,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by developmental regression loss of communicative ability stereotyped hand wringing cognitive impairment and central apneas among many other symptoms. RTT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in a methyl-reader known as methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) a protein that links epigenetic changes on DNA to larger chromatin structure. Historically target identification for RTT has relied heavily on Mecp2 knockout mice; however we recently adopted the alternative approach of performing transcriptional profiling in autopsy samples from RTT patients. Through this mechanism we identified muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) as potential therapeutic targets. Here we characterized a cohort of 40 temporal cortex samples from individuals with RTT and quantified significantly decreased levels of the M(1) M(2) M(3) and M(5) mAChRs subtypes relative to neurotypical controls. Of these four subtypes M(1) expression demonstrated a linear relationship with MeCP2 expression such that M(1) levels were only diminished in contexts where MeCP2 was also significantly decreased. Further we show that M(1) potentiation with the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0453595 (VU595) rescued social preference spatial memory and associative memory deficits as well as decreased apneas in Mecp2(+/-) mice. VU595's efficacy on apneas in Mecp2(+/-) mice was mediated by the facilitation of the transition from inspiration to expiration. Molecular analysis correlated rescue with normalized global gene expression patterns in the brainstem and hippocampus as well as increased Gsk3β inhibition and NMDA receptor trafficking. Together these data suggest that M(1) PAMs could represent a new class of RTT therapeutics.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131586124&doi=10.1007%2fs13311-022-01254-3&partnerID=40&md5=29923121eee750f07612705ea999f388","Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Neuroscience Loyola University Chicago Maywood IL 60153 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rEdward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Hines IL 60141 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rWarren Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rVanderbilt Kennedy Center Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rVanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Chemistry Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rVanderbilt Brain Institute Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular Pharmacology and Neuroscience Loyola University Chicago Maywood IL 60153 USA. rgogliotti@luc.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rEdward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Hines IL 60141 USA. rgogliotti@luc.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA. rgogliotti@luc.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rWarren Center for Neuroscience Drug Discovery Vanderbilt University Nashville TN 37232 USA. rgogliotti@luc.edu.",2022,"10.1007/s13311-022-01254-3","Article","MiceAnimals*Rett Syndrome/drug therapy/genetics/metabolismMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolismApneaReceptors N-Methyl-D-AspartateGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/metabolismMice KnockoutReceptors Muscarinic/genetics/metabolismChromatinApneasBrainstemCognitionGsk3βM1 mAChRRett syndrome","pubmed-35670902.pdf","pubmed-35670902","xml_texts/PMC9587166.xml","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs13311-022-01254-3.txt","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs13311-022-01254-3.pdf"

MeCP2-deficient mice recapitulate the neurological degeneration observed in RTT patients. Recent studies indicated a role of not only neurons but also glial cells in neuronal dysfunction in RTT. We cultured astrocytes from MeCP2-null mouse brain and examined astroglial gene expression growth rate cytotoxic effects and glutamate (Glu) clearance. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of astroglial marker genes including GFAP and S100β was significantly higher in MeCP2-null astrocytes than in control astrocytes. Loss of MeCP2 did not affect astroglial cell morphology growth or cytotoxic effects but did alter Glu clearance in astrocytes. When high extracellular Glu was added to the astrocyte cultures and incubated a time-dependent decrease of extracellular Glu concentration occurred due to Glu clearance by astrocytes. Although the shapes of the profiles of Glu concentration versus time for each strain of astrocytes were grossly similar Glu concentration in the medium of MeCP2-null astrocytes were lower than those of control astrocytes at 12 and 18 h. In addition MeCP2 deficiency impaired downregulation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and 2 (EAAT1/2) transcripts but not induction of glutamine synthetase (GS) transcripts upon high Glu exposure. In contrast GS protein was significantly higher in MeCP2-null astrocytes than in control astrocytes. These findings suggest that MeCP2 affects astroglial genes expression in cultured astrocytes and that abnormal Glu clearance in MeCP2-deficient astrocytes may influence the onset and progression of RTT.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860015853&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0035354&partnerID=40&md5=2a3aec4c454f0d49c46ce57107e5031d","Division of Gene Therapy and Regenerative Medicine Cognitive and Molecular Research Institute of Brain Diseases Kurume University Kurume Japan.",2012,"10.1371/journal.pone.0035354","Article","Amino Acid Transport System X-AG/genetics/metabolismAnimalsAstrocytes/*metabolismBrain/metabolismCells Cultured*Gene ExpressionGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics/metabolismGlutamate-Ammonia Ligase/genetics/metabolismGlutamic Acid/genetics/*metabolismMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/genetics/*metabolismMiceMice KnockoutNerve Growth Factors/genetics/metabolismNeurons/metabolismRett Syndrome/genetics/*metabolismS100 Calcium Binding Protein beta SubunitS100 Proteins/genetics/metabolism","pubmed-22532851.pdf","pubmed-22532851","xml_texts/PMC3332111.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035354.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035354.pdf"
"Role of CTCF Protein in Regulating FMR1 Locus Transcription","Lanni S., Goracci M., Borrelli L., Mancano G., Chiurazzi P., Moscato U., Ferrè F., Helmer-Citterich M., Tabolacci E., Neri G.","PLoS Genetics",NA,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability, is caused by epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 gene, through expansion and methylation of a CGG triplet repeat (methylated full mutation). An antisense transcript (FMR1-AS1), starting from both promoter and intron 2 of the FMR1 gene, was demonstrated in transcriptionally active alleles, but not in silent FXS alleles. Moreover, a DNA methylation boundary, which is lost in FXS, was recently identified upstream of the FMR1 gene. Several nuclear proteins bind to this region, like the insulator protein CTCF. Here we demonstrate for the first time that rare unmethylated full mutation (UFM) alleles present the same boundary described in wild type (WT) alleles and that CTCF binds to this region, as well as to the FMR1 gene promoter, exon 1 and intron 2 binding sites. Contrariwise, DNA methylation prevents CTCF binding to FXS alleles. Drug-induced CpGs demethylation does not restore this binding. CTCF knock-down experiments clearly established that CTCF does not act as insulator at the active FMR1 locus, despite the presence of a CGG expansion. CTCF depletion induces heterochromatinic histone configuration of the FMR1 locus and results in reduction of FMR1 transcription, which however is not accompanied by spreading of DNA methylation towards the FMR1 promoter. CTCF depletion is also associated with FMR1-AS1 mRNA reduction. Antisense RNA, like sense transcript, is upregulated in UFM and absent in FXS cells and its splicing is correlated to that of the FMR1-mRNA. We conclude that CTCF has a complex role in regulating FMR1 expression, probably through the organization of chromatin loops between sense/antisense transcriptional regulatory regions, as suggested by bioinformatics analysis. © 2013 Lanni et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880799926&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1003601&partnerID=40&md5=ba28f67bcf710427840ba211b291465c","Istituto di Genetica Medica, Università Cattolica del S.

"Trans-synaptic zinc mobilization improves social interaction in two mouse models of autism through NMDAR activation","Lee E. J.Lee H.Huang T. N.Chung C.Shin W.Kim K.Koh J. Y.Hsueh Y. P.Kim E.","Nat Commun",NA,"Genetic aspects of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have recently been extensively explored but environmental influences that affect ASDs have received considerably less attention. Zinc (Zn) is a nutritional factor implicated in ASDs but evidence for a strong association and linking mechanism is largely lacking. Here we report that trans-synaptic Zn mobilization rapidly rescues social interaction in two independent mouse models of ASD. In mice lacking Shank2 an excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein postsynaptic Zn elevation induced by clioquinol (a Zn chelator and ionophore) improves social interaction. Postsynaptic Zn is mainly derived from presynaptic pools and activates NMDA receptors (NMDARs) through postsynaptic activation of the tyrosine kinase Src. Clioquinol also improves social interaction in mice haploinsufficient for the transcription factor Tbr1 which accompanies NMDAR activation in the amygdala. These results suggest that trans-synaptic Zn mobilization induced by clioquinol rescues social deficits in mouse models of ASD through postsynaptic Src and NMDAR activation.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929347256&doi=10.1038%2fncomms8168&partnerID=40&md5=78d362ce6b565a800a0008a3c0a2b98b","Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Daejeon 305-701 Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions Institute for Basic Science (IBS) Daejeon 305-701 Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biological Sciences Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Daejeon 305-701 Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute of Molecular Biology Academia Sinica Taipei 115 Taiwan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeural Injury Research Lab University of Ulsan College of Medicine Seoul 138-736 Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAsan Institute for Life Science University of Ulsan College of Medicine Seoul 138-736 Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology University of Ulsan College of Medicine Seoul 138-736 Korea.",2015,"10.1038/ncomms8168","Article","Amygdala/metabolismAnimalsAutistic Disorder/*physiopathologyBehavior AnimalChelating Agents/chemistryClioquinol/chemistryCrosses GeneticDNA-Binding Proteins/metabolismDendrites/metabolismDisease Models AnimalElectrophysiologyFemaleHaploinsufficiencyHippocampus/metabolismIonophores/chemistryMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice TransgenicNerve Tissue Proteins/metabolismReceptors N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*metabolismSocial BehaviorSynapses/*metabolismSynaptic Transmission/physiologyT-Box Domain ProteinsZinc/*chemistrysrc-Family Kinases/metabolism","pubmed-25981743.pdf","pubmed-25981743","xml_texts/PMC4479043.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fncomms8168.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fncomms8168.pdf"

In the Barwon Infant Study birth cohort (n = 1074), higher prenatal maternal bisphenol A (BPA) levels are associated with higher ASD symptoms at age 2 and diagnosis at age 9 only in males with low aromatase genetic pathway activity scores. Higher prenatal BPA levels are predictive of higher cord blood methylation across the CYP19A1 brain promoter I.f region (P = 0.009) and aromatase gene methylation mediates (P = 0.01) the link between higher prenatal BPA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor methylation, with independent cohort replication. BPA suppressed aromatase expression in vitro and in vivo.

Combined with four patients previously reported a total of 11 patients with this disorder have now been identified. We expand the phenotypic and variation spectrum associated with defects in this gene. Patients have strong phenotypic overlap suggesting a defined autosomal recessive syndrome caused by reduced function of PTPN23. Shared characteristics of affected individuals include developmental delay brain abnormalities (mainly ventriculomegaly and/or brain atrophy) intellectual disability spasticity language disorder microcephaly optic atrophy and seizures. We observe a broad range of variants across patients that are likely strongly reducing the expression or disrupting the function of the protein. However we do not observe any patients with an allele combination predicted to result in complete loss of function of PTPN23 as this is likely incompatible with life consistent with reported embryonic lethality in the mouse. None of the observed or reported variants are recurrent although some have been identified in homozygosis in patients from consanguineous populations. This study expands the phenotypic and molecular spectrum of PTPN23 associated disease and identifies major shared features among patients affected with this disorder while providing additional support to the important role of PTPN23 in human nervous and visual system development and function.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070816732&doi=10.1038%2fs41431-019-0487-1&partnerID=40&md5=4bf1952dd9527f50bc2c05c4c389bc4e","Greenwood Genetic Center Greenwood SC 29646 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rRaphael Recanati Genetic Institute Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel 49100 Petah-Tiqva Israel.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rChildren's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute University of Ottawa Ottawa ON K1H 8L1 Canada.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rOchsner Medical Center New Orleans LA 70121 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDuke Institute for Brain Sciences Durham NC 27710 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rGeneDx Gaithersburg MD 20877 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rChildren's National Medical Center Washington DC 20010 USA. carlos.ferreira@nih.gov.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rRegeneron Genetics Center Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Methods: Since p-cresol is a known uremic toxin able to negatively affect multiple brain functions the present study was undertaken to assess the effects of a single acute injection of low- or high-dose (1 or 10 mg/kg i.v. respectively) of p-cresol in behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes of BTBR mice a reliable animal model of human ASD. Results: P-cresol significantly increased anxiety-like behaviors and hyperactivity in the open field in addition to producing stereotypic behaviors and loss of social preference in BTBR mice. Tissue levels of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and their metabolites unveiled significantly activated dopamine turnover in amygdala as well as in dorsal and ventral striatum after p-cresol administration; no effect was recorded in medial-prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.

Current therapeutic approaches are entirely symptomatic however the ability to rescue phenotypes in mouse models of other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome Angelman syndrome and Phelan-McDermid syndrome by postnatal expression of gene products has led to hope that similar approaches could help modify the disease course in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as FS. While FoxG1 protein function plays a critical role in embryonic brain development the ongoing adult expression of FoxG1 and behavioral phenotypes that present when FoxG1 function is removed postnatally provides support for opportunity for improvement with postnatal treatment. Here we generated a new mouse allele of Foxg1 that disrupts protein expression and characterized the behavioral and structural brain phenotypes in heterozygous mutant animals. These mutant animals display changes in locomotor behavior gait anxiety social interaction aggression and learning and memory compared to littermate controls.

Up to 60% of affected males fulfill criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making FXS the most frequent monogenetic cause of syndromic ASD. It is unknown, however, whether normal variants (independent of mutations) in the fragile X gene family (FMR1, FXR1, FXR2) and in FMR2 modulate autistic features. Here, we report an accumulation model of 8 SNPs in these genes, associated with autistic traits in a discovery sample of male patients with schizophrenia (N = 692) and three independent replicate samples: patients with schizophrenia (N = 626), patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (N = 111) and a general population sample (N = 2005). For first mechanistic insight, we contrasted microRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of selected extreme group subjects with high- versus low-risk constellation regarding the accumulation model. Thereby, the brain-expressed miR-181 species emerged as potential ""umbrella regulator"", with several seed matches across the fragile X gene family and FMR2. To conclude, normal variation in these genes contributes to the continuum of autistic phenotypes. Synopsis: Based on a novel approach, phenotype-based genetic association study, first evidence is provided that a particular constellation of completely normal genotypes in the ""broader fragile X gene family"" contributes to autistic phenotypes. An accumulation model of 8 SNPs from the broader fragile X gene family (FMR1, FXR1, FXR2, and FMR2) is associated with autistic traits in a discovery sample of male schizophrenia patients as well as three independent replication samples of neuropsychiatric patients or general population. The underlying novel approach, named phenotype-based genetic association study (PGAS), may serve as universal guide in the exploration of genotype contributions to quantifiable phenotypes. Comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells of extreme group subjects with high versus low genetic risk by small RNA sequencing revealed quantitative differences in the brain-expressed miR-181 family, which has several seed matches across the broader fragile X gene family. Future studies based on extensive in vivo work in animal models are needed to delineate how and when the miR-181 family may act as an overarching modulator of the fragile X genes.

While inhibitors of the ERK activating kinases MEK1/2 are promising as a means to treat NF1, the broad blockade of the ERK pathway produced by this strategy is potentially associated with therapy limiting toxicities. Here, we have sought targets offering a more narrow inhibition of ERK activation downstream of NF1 loss in the skeleton, finding that MEKK2 is a novel component of a noncanonical ERK pathway in osteoblasts that mediates aberrant ERK activation after NF1 loss. Accordingly, despite mice with conditional deletion of Nf1 in mature osteoblasts (Nf1fl/fl;Dmp1-Cre) and Mekk2−/− each displaying skeletal defects, Nf1fl/fl;Mekk2−/−;Dmp1-Cre mice show an amelioration of NF1-associated phenotypes. We also provide proof-of-principle that FDA-approved inhibitors with activity against MEKK2 can ameliorate NF1 skeletal pathology. Thus, MEKK2 functions as a MAP3K in the ERK pathway in osteoblasts, offering a potential new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NF1. © 2020, The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095830501&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-020-19555-6&partnerID=40&md5=12d94b8f4f1e9b436f11f87b014bf7a1","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY  10065, United States; Research Center, LegoChem BioSciences, INC., Daejeon, 34302, South Korea; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian  361102, China; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biomanufacturing Research Institute and Technology Enterprise (BRITE), North Carolina Central University, Durham, NC  27707, United States; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, and the Minister of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Death and Differentiation, Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China; Yale Institute for Immune Metabolism, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA  01605, United States",2020,"10.1038/s41467-020-19555-6","Article","1 cyclopropyl 3 [3 (5 morpholinomethyl 1h benzimidazol 2 yl) 1h pyrazol 4 yl]urea; bosutinib; brite 0600690; brite 0600719; crizotinib; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; ponatinib; protein serine threonine kinase inhibitor; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; Dmp1 protein, mouse; imidazole derivative; Map3k2 protein, mouse; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2; neurofibromin; NF1 protein, human; ponatinib; protein kinase inhibitor; pyridazine derivative; scleroprotein; cancer; disease severity; disease treatment; gene expression; inhibition; nervous system disorder; physiological response; skeleton; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone disease; cell maturation; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; female; gene deletion; genetic association; loss of function mutation; male; MAPK signaling; mouse; neurofibromatosis type 1; nonhuman; osteoblast; phenotype; protein depletion; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; animal; cytology; disease model; enzyme activation; genetics; human; metabolism; neurofibromatosis type 1; phosphorylation; skull; transgenic mouse; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme Activation; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Humans; Imidazoles; Male; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2; Mice, Transgenic; Neurofibromatosis 1; Neurofibromin 1; Osteoblasts; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Pyridazines; Skull","scopus-85095830501.pdf","scopus-85095830501","xml_texts/PMC7658220.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19555-6.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19555-6.pdf"

Here we show that acute viral manipulation of MeCP2 expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) bidirectionally modulates amphetamine (AMPH)-induced conditioned place preference. Mecp2 hypomorphic mutant mice have more NAc GABAergic synapses and show deficient AMPH-induced structural plasticity of NAc dendritic spines. Furthermore these mice show deficient plasticity of striatal immediate early gene inducibility after repeated AMPH administration. Notably psychostimulants induce phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421 a site that regulates MeCP2's function as a repressor. Phosphorylation is selectively induced in GABAergic interneurons of the NAc and its extent strongly predicts the degree of behavioral sensitization.

In this study we examined the in vivo role of PHF2 in mice. We generated Phf2 floxed mice systemic Phf2 null mice by crossing Phf2 floxed mice with CMV-Cre transgenic mice and tamoxifen-inducible Phf2 knockout mice by crossing Phf2 floxed mice with Cre-ERT2 transgenic mice. Systemic Phf2 null mice had partial neonatal death and growth retardation and exhibited less adipose tissue and reduced adipocyte numbers compared with control littermates. Tamoxifen-induced conditional knockout of PHF2 resulted in impaired adipogenesis in stromal vascular cells from the adipose tissue of tamoxifen-inducible Phf2 knockout mice as well as of Phf2 knocked-down 3T3-L1 cells. PHF2 interacts with CEBPA and demethylates H3K9me2 in the promoters of CEBPA-regulated adipogenic genes. These findings suggest that PHF2 histone demethylase potentiates adipogenesis through interaction with CEBPA in vivo.

Previous studies have proved inconsistent across several behavioral endpoints thought to be dependent on dentate neurogenesis, including memory acquisition, short-term and long-term retention of memory, pattern separation, and reversal learning. We hypothesized that the main function of dentate neurogenesis is long-term memory formation because we assumed that a newly formed and integrated neuron would have a long-term impact on the local neural network. We used a cyclin D2-knock-out (cyclin D2(-/-)) mouse model of endogenously deficient dentate neurogenesis to test this hypothesis. We found that cyclin D2(-/-) mice had robust and sustained loss of long-term memory in two separate behavioral tasks, Morris water maze (MWM) and touchscreen intermediate pattern separation. Moreover, after adjusting for differences in brain volumes determined by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, reduced dentate neurogenesis moderately correlated with deficits in memory retention after 24hours.

"Synapsin I Controls Synaptic Maturation of Long-Range Projections in the Lateral Amygdala in a Targeted Selective Fashion","Lugara, E; De Fusco, A; Lignani, G; Benfenati, F; Humeau, Y","FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE",NA,"The amygdala, and more precisely its lateral nucleus, is thought to attribute emotional valence to external stimuli by generating long-term plasticity changes at long-range projections to principal cells. Aversive experience has also been shown to modify pre- and post-synaptic markers in the amygdala, suggesting their possible role in the structural organization of adult amygdala networks. Here, we focused on how the maturation of cortical and thalamic long-range projections occurs on principal neurons and interneurons in the lateral amygdala (LA). We performed dual electrophysiological recordings of identified cells in juvenile and adult GAD67-GFP mice after independent stimulation of cortical and thalamic afferent systems. The results demonstrate that synaptic strengthening occurs during development at synapses projecting to LA principal neurons, but not interneurons. As synaptic strengthening underlies fear conditioning which depends, in turn, on presence and increasing expression of synapsin I, we tested if synapsin I contributes to synaptic strengthening during development. Interestingly, the physiological synaptic strengthening of cortical and thalamic synapses projecting to LA principal neurons was virtually abolished in synapsin I knockout mice, but not differences were observed in the excitatory projections to interneurons. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the presence of synapsin I is restricted to excitatory contacts projecting to principal neurons in LA of adult mice. These results indicate that synapsin I is a key regulator of the maturation of synaptic connectivity in this brain region and that is expression is dependent on postsynaptic identity.",NA,NA,2019,"10.3389/fncel.2019.00220","Article",NA,"wos-000468618500001.pdf","wos-000468618500001","xml_texts/PMC6536628.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2019.00220.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2019.00220.pdf"
"Finding novel distinctions between the sAPP alpha-mediated anabolic biochemical pathways in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Fragile X Syndrome plasma and brain tissue","Ray, B; Sokol, DK; Maloney, B; Lahiri, DK","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are developmental disorders. No validated blood-based biomarkers exist for either, which impedes bench-to-bedside approaches. Amyloid-beta (A beta) precursor protein (APP) and metabolites are usually associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP cleavage by a-secretase produces potentially neurotrophic secreted APP alpha (sAPP alpha) and the P3 peptide fragment. beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleavage produces secreted APP beta (sAPP beta) and intact A beta. Excess A beta is potentially neurotoxic and can lead to atrophy of brain regions such as amygdala in AD. By contrast, amygdala is enlarged in ASD but not FXS. We previously reported elevated levels of sAPPa in ASD and FXS vs. controls. We now report elevated plasma A beta and total APP levels in FXS compared to both ASD and typically developing controls, and elevated levels of sAPPa in ASD and FXS vs. controls. By contrast, plasma and brain sAPP beta and A beta were lower in ASD vs. controls but elevated in FXS plasma vs. controls. We also detected age-dependent increase in an a-secretase in ASD brains.

However, the mechanism of such modulatory effect and the safety of applied methods on individuals involved in social support need further investigation. We took advantage of known differences between inbred mouse strains to reveal the effect of social enrichment on behavior and neurobiology of animals with different behavioral phenotypes. C57BL/6 and DBA/2 female mice displaying multiple differences in cognitive, social, and emotional behavior were group-housed either in same-strain or in mixed-strain conditions. Comprehensive behavioral phenotyping and analysis of expression of several plasticity- and stress-related genes were done to measure the reciprocal effects of social interaction between the strains. Contrary to our expectation, mixed housing did not change the behavior of DBA/2 mice. Nevertheless, the level of serum corticosterone and the expression of glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 in the brain were increased in mixed housed DBA/2 as compared with those of separately housed DBA/2 mice. In contrast, socially active C57BL/6 animals were more sensitive to the mixed housing, displaying several signs of stress: alterations in learning, social, and anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by the elevated serum corticosterone and the reduced expression of Nr3c1, as well as the elevated Bdnf levels in the cortex and hippocampus.

Mice harbouring knockout mutations in the Mecp2 gene display many RTT-like characteristics and are central to efforts to find novel therapies for the disorder. As hand stereotypies and gait abnormalities constitute major diagnostic criteria in RTT it is clear that motor and gait-related phenotypes will be of importance in assessing preclinical therapeutic outcomes. We therefore aimed to assess gait properties over the prodromal phase in a functional knockout mouse model of RTT. In male Mecp2 knockout mice we observed alterations in stride coordination and balance parameters at 4 weeks of age before the onset of other overt phenotypic changes as revealed by observational scoring.

Grin1 is a candidate susceptibility gene for neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In our previous study we examined an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-generated mutant mouse strain (Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+) that has a non-synonymous mutation in Grin1. These mutant mice showed hyperactivity increased novelty-seeking to objects and abnormal social interactions. Therefore Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+ mice may serve as a potential animal model of neuropsychiatric disorders. However other behavioral characteristics related to these disorders such as working memory function and sensorimotor gating have not been fully explored in these mutant mice. In this study to further investigate the behavioral phenotypes of Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+ mice we subjected them to a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in nociception between Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+ and wild-type mice. The mutants did not display any abnormalities in the Porsolt forced swim and tail suspension tests. We confirmed the previous observations that the locomotor activity of these mutant mice increased in the open field and home cage activity tests. They displayed abnormal anxiety-like behaviors in the light/dark transition and the elevated plus maze tests. Both contextual and cued fear memory were severely deficient in the fear conditioning test. The mutant mice exhibited slightly impaired working memory in the eight-arm radial maze test. The startle amplitude was markedly decreased in Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+ mice whereas no significant differences between genotypes were detected in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) test. The mutant mice showed no obvious deficits in social behaviors in three different social interaction tests. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the Grin1(Rgsc174)/Grin1+ mutation causes abnormal anxiety-like behaviors a deficiency in fear memory and a decreased startle amplitude in mice.

These include a range of neuroanatomical comorbidities which likely underlie the varied neurodevelopmental disorders associated with CHARGE syndrome, which include intellectual disability, motor coordination deficits, executive dysfunction, and autism spectrum disorder. Cranial imaging studies are challenging in CHARGE syndrome patients, but high-throughput magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in mouse models allow for the unbiased identification of neuroanatomical defects. Here, we present a comprehensive neuroanatomical survey of a Chd7 haploinsufficient mouse model of CHARGE syndrome. Our study uncovered widespread brain hypoplasia and reductions in white matter volume across the brain. The severity of hypoplasia appeared more pronounced in posterior areas of the neocortex compared to anterior regions. We also perform the first assessment of white matter tract integrity in this model through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess the potential functional consequences of widespread reductions in myelin, which suggested the presence of white matter integrity defects. To determine if white matter alterations correspond to cellular changes, we quantified oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the postnatal corpus callosum, uncovering reduced numbers of mature oligodendrocytes.

P.Srivastava L. K.","Neuropsychopharmacology",NA,"Neonatal ventral hippocampus (nVH) lesion in rats is a useful model to study developmental origins of adult cognitive deficits and certain features of schizophrenia. nVH lesion-induced reorganization of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions within prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits is widely believed to be responsible for many of the behavioral abnormalities in these animals. Here we provide evidence that development of an aberrant medial PFC (mPFC) α-1 adrenergic receptor (α-1AR) function following neonatal lesion markedly affects glutamatergic synaptic plasticity within PFC microcircuits and contributes to PFC-related behavior abnormalities. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording we report that norepinephrine-induced α-1AR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in a subset of cortico-cortical glutamatergic inputs is strikingly diminished in mPFC slices from nVH-lesioned rats. The LTD impairment occurs in conjunction with completely blunted α-1AR signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. These α-1AR abnormalities have functional significance in a mPFC-related function that is extinction of conditioned fear memory. Post-pubertal animals with nVH lesion show significant resistance to extinction of fear by repeated presentations of the conditioned tone stimulus. mPFC infusion of an α-1AR antagonist (benoxathian) or LTD blocking peptide (Tat-GluR23Y) impaired fear extinction in sham controls but had no significant effect in the lesioned animals.

Seventy percent of Kabuki Syndrome patients have mutations in the histone methyl-transferase KMT2D. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive these congenital disorders are unknown. Here, we generated and characterized zebrafish kmt2d null mutants that recapitulate the cardinal phenotypic features of Kabuki Syndrome, including microcephaly, palate defects, abnormal ear development, and cardiac defects. The cardiac phenotype consists of a previously unknown vasculogenesis defect that affects endocardium patterning and, consequently, heart ventricle lumen formation. Additionally, zebrafish kmt2d null mutants have angiogenesis defects depicted by abnormal aortic arch development, hyperactive ectopic blood vessel sprouting, and aberrant patterning of the brain vascular plexus. We demonstrate that zebrafish kmt2d null mutants have robust Notch signaling hyperactivation in endocardial and endothelial cells, including increased protein levels of the Notch transcription factor Rbpj. Our zebrafish Kabuki Syndrome model reveals a regulatory link between the Notch pathway and Kmt2d during endothelium and endocardium patterning and shows that pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling rebalances Rbpj protein levels and rescues the cardiovascular phenotype by enhancing endothelial and endocardial cell proliferation and stabilizing endocardial patterning. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Kmt2d regulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, provide evidence for interactions between Kmt2d and Notch signaling in Kabuki Syndrome, and suggest future directions for clinical research.",NA,NA,2019,"10.1371/journal.pbio.3000087","Article",NA,"wos-000496470000012.pdf","wos-000496470000012","xml_texts/PMC6743796.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3000087.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3000087.pdf"

The interaction between astrocytes and neurons has been suggested to play a role in the abnormal neuronal activity observed in epilepsy. However, the exact way astrocytes influence neuronal activity in the epileptogenic brain remains unclear. Here, using the PTZ-induced kindling mouse model, we evaluated the interaction between astrocyte and synaptic function by measuring astrocytic Ca 2+  activity, neuronal excitability, and the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the hippocampus. Compared to control mice, hippocampal slices from PTZ-kindled mice displayed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels and an abnormal pattern of intracellular Ca 2+ -oscillations, characterized by an increased frequency of prolonged spontaneous transients. PTZ-kindled hippocampal slices also showed an increase in the E/I ratio towards excitation, likely resulting from an augmented release probability of excitatory inputs without affecting inhibitory synapses. Notably, the alterations in the release probability seen in PTZ-kindled slices can be recovered by reducing astrocyte hyperactivity with the reversible toxin fluorocitrate. This suggests that astroglial hyper-reactivity enhances excitatory synaptic transmission, thereby impacting the E/I balance in the hippocampus.

Further voltage-sensitive calcium channel expression is reduced in the pancreas of the fragile X mouse. Since there are considerable similarities in the GABAergic system in the brain and pancreas we evaluated the protective role of taurine in pancreatic islet development in both wild type (WT) and fragile X mice (KO). METHODS: One-month-old FVB/NJ males or age-matched fmr1-knockout (KO) mice were supplemented with taurine in drinking water (0.05% w/v) for four weeks. Age-matched controls were fed water only for the same duration. At four weeks mice were sacrificed and pancreases processed for histology and immunohistochemical studies on changes of insulin glucagon and somatostatin expression. Additional mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Taurine treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number and size of islets. WT taurine-fed mice slightly hypoglycemic prior to glucose injection showed significantly reduced plasma glucose at 30 min post-injection when compared to control mice. KO mice had normal baseline plasma glucose concentration; however following glucose injection they had higher plasma glucose levels at 30 min when compared to controls. Supplementation of taurine to KO mice resulted in reduced baseline levels of plasma glucose. After glucose injection the taurine-fed KO mice had reduced plasma glucose at 30 min compared to KO. Concomitant with the increased islets size and glucose tolerance observed in taurine-fed mice there was an increase in insulin glucagon and somatostatin immunoreactivity in the islets of WT mice. In the KO mice however insulin levels were not affected whereas glucagon and somatostatin levels were reduced. Exocytosis of these hormones is calcium-dependent therefore any exacerbation of calcium homeostasis could affect hormone release. We found the expression of the voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) is drastically reduced in the pancreas of fragile X mice. CONCLUSIONS: During early development the VSCC play an important role in calcium-dependent gene expression. Since these channels are also involved in depolarization and calcium-mediated vesicular release of neurotransmitters and pancreatic hormones alterations in the expression of VSCC not only will affect calcium-mediated gene expression but also hormonal and neurotransmitter release creating therefore a neuroendocrine perturbation in the fragile X that may potentially affect other organ systems. We find that in the fragile X mouse taurine treatment may partially restore functionality of the neuro-endocrine pancreas.",NA,"Department of Biology College of Staten Island The City University of New York 2800 Victory Boulevard Staten Island NY 10314 USA.

It is composed of five highly homologous genes referred to as Tafa-1 to -5. Among them Tafa-2 is identified as one of the potential genes responsible for intellectual deficiency in a patient with mild mental retardation. To investigate the biological function of Tafa-2 in vivo Tafa-2 knockout mice were generated. The mutant mice grew and developed normally but exhibited impairments in spatial learning and memory in Morris water maze test and impairments in short- and long-term memory in novel object recognition test accompanied with increased level of anxiety-like behaviors in open-field test and elevated plus maze test and decreased level of depression-like behaviors in forced-swim test and tail-suspension test. Further examinations revealed that Tafa-2 deficiency causes severe neuronal reduction and increased apoptosis in the brain of Tafa-2-/- mice via downregulation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways. Conformably the expression levels of CREB target genes including BDNF c-fos and NF1 and CBP were found to be reduced in the brain of Tafa-2-/- mice.

"Assessment of social interaction behaviors","Kaidanovich-Beilin O.Lipina T.Vukobradovic I.Roder J.Woodgett J. R.","J Vis Exp",NA,"Social interactions are a fundamental and adaptive component of the biology of numerous species. Social recognition is critical for the structure and stability of the networks and relationships that define societies. For animals such as mice recognition of conspecifics may be important for maintaining social hierarchy and for mate choice. A variety of neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by disruptions in social behavior and social recognition including depression autism spectrum disorders bipolar disorders obsessive-compulsive disorders and schizophrenia. Studies of humans as well as animal models (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans Mus musculus Rattus norvegicus) have identified genes involved in the regulation of social behavior. To assess sociability in animal models several behavioral tests have been developed (reviewed in (3)). Integrative research using animal models and appropriate tests for social behavior may lead to the development of improved treatments for social psychopathologies. The three-chamber paradigm test known as Crawley's sociability and preference for social novelty protocol has been successfully employed to study social affiliation and social memory in several inbred and mutant mouse lines (e.g. (4-7)). The main principle of this test is based on the free choice by a subject mouse to spend time in any of three box's compartments during two experimental sessions including indirect contact with one or two mice with which it is unfamiliar. To quantitate social tendencies of the experimental mouse the main tasks are to measure a) the time spent with a novel conspecific and b) preference for a novel vs. a familiar conspecific. Thus the experimental design of this test allows evaluation of two critical but distinguishable aspects of social behavior such as social affiliation/motivation as well as social memory and novelty. ""Sociability"" in this case is defined as propensity to spend time with another mouse as compared to time spent alone in an identical but empty chamber. ""Preference for social novelty"" is defined as propensity to spend time with a previously unencountered mouse rather than with a familiar mouse. This test provides robust results which then must be carefully analyzed interpreted and supported/confirmed by alternative sociability tests. In addition to specific applications Crawley's sociability test can be included as an important component of general behavioral screen of mutant mice.",NA,"Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute Mount Sinai Hospital USA.",2011,"10.3791/2473","Article","Animals*Behavior AnimalBehavioral Research/instrumentation/*methodsMiceMice Knockout*Social Behavior","pubmed-21403628.pdf","pubmed-21403628","xml_texts/PMC3197404.xml","full_texts/10.3791%2F2473.txt","full_texts/10.3791%2F2473.pdf"

The RhoA GTPases Rnd2 and Rnd3 are important for neurogenesis and cell migration within the embryonic cortex (Nat Commun 4:1635 2013) and we recently identified the BTB/POZ domain-containing Adaptor for Cul3-mediated RhoA Degradation family member Bacurd2 (also known as Tnfaip1) as an interacting partner to Rnd2 for the migration of embryonic mouse cortical neurons (Neural Dev 10:9 2015). FINDINGS: We have extended this work and report that Bacurd1/Kctd13 and Bacurd2/Tnfaip1 are interacting partners to Rnd2 and Rnd3 in vitro. Given that these genes are expressed during cortical development we performed a series of in utero electroporation studies in mice and found that disruptions to Bacurd1/Kctd13 or Bacurd2/Tnfaip1 expression impair the long-term positioning of E14.5-born cortical neurons within the postnatal (P17) mouse cerebral cortex.

As these functions would predict deregulation of chromatin-remodeling factors causes various disease syndromes including neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent reports have linked mutations in several genes coding for chromatin-remodeling factors to intellectual disability (ID). Here we used exome sequencing and identified a nonsynonymous de novo mutation in BAZ1A (NM_182648.2:c.4043T > G p.Phe1348Cys) encoding the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor 1 (ACF1) in a patient with unexplained ID. ACF1 has been previously reported to bind to the promoter of the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-regulated genes and suppress their expression. Our results show that the patient displays decreased binding of ACF1 to the promoter of the VDR-regulated gene CYP24A1. Using RNA sequencing we find that the mutation affects the expression of genes involved in several pathways including vitamin D metabolism Wnt signaling and synaptic formation. RNA sequencing of BAZ1A knockdown cells and Baz1a knockout mice revealed that BAZ1A carry out distinctive functions in different tissues.

Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. In both species, males and females were examined. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as 'error' signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from  Fmr1 -/-  mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS. Significance Statement Sensory hypersensitivity, impulsivity, and persistent inattention are among the most consistent clinical features of FXS, all of which impede daily functioning and create barriers to learning. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sensory over-reactivity remain elusive. To overcome a significant challenge in translational FXS research we demonstrate a compelling alignment of sensory over-reactivity in both humans with FXS and  Fmr1 -/-  mice (the principal animal model of FXS) using a novel analogous distractor task. Two photon microscopy in mice reveal that dysfunctional VIP cells contribute to susceptibility to distractors. Implementing research efforts we describe here, can help identify dysfunctional neural mechanisms associated not only with sensory issues, but broader impairments, including those in learning and cognition.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37816596","University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Riverside; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University of California System; University of California San Francisco",2023,"10.1523/jneurosci.0571-23.2023","Article","COOCCURRING CONDITIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MOUSE MODEL; LONG-RANGE; FMR1 GENE; ATTENTION; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; INDIVIDUALS; INHIBITION","pubmed-37816596.pdf","pubmed-37816596","xml_texts/PMC10697397.xml","full_texts/10.1523%2Fjneurosci.0571-23.2023.txt","full_texts/10.1523%2Fjneurosci.0571-23.2023.pdf"

Although reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillation has been suggested to be a result of reduced parvalbumin-immunoreactive (putatively GABAergic) neurons no direct correlations between these have been established in these disorders. In the present study we investigated such relationships during pharmacological treatment with a newly synthesized drug T-817MA which displays neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. In this study we used platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β gene knockout (PDGFR-β KO) mice as an animal model of schizophrenia and autism. These mutant mice display a reduction in social behaviors; deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI); reduced levels of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the medical prefrontal cortex hippocampus amygdala and superior colliculus; and a deficit in of auditory phase-locked gamma oscillations. We found that oral administration of T-817MA ameliorated all these symptoms in the PDGFR-β KO mice. Furthermore phase-locked gamma oscillations were significantly correlated with the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons which was in turn correlated with PPI and behavioral parameters. These findings suggest that recovery of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons by pharmacological intervention relieved the reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillations and consequently ameliorated PPI and social behavioral deficits. Thus our findings suggest that phase-locked gamma oscillations could be a useful physiological biomarker for abnormality of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons that may induce cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and autism as well as of effective pharmacological interventions in both humans and experimental animals.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925874796&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0119258&partnerID=40&md5=c514d6dce95fdc083dd81c9593912672","System Emotional Science Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Toyama Sugitani 2630 Toyama Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pathology Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Toyama Sugitani 2630 Toyama Japan.",2015,"10.1371/journal.pone.0119258","Article","AnimalsAutistic Disorder/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathologyGABAergic Neurons/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*pathologyImmunohistochemistryInterpersonal RelationsMaleMaleates/pharmacologyMiceMice KnockoutModels AnimalParvalbumins/*immunologyPrefrontal Cortex/metabolism/pathologyPrepulse Inhibition/drug effectsReceptor Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*geneticsSchizophrenia/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathologyThiophenes/pharmacology","pubmed-25803852.pdf","pubmed-25803852","xml_texts/PMC4372342.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0119258.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0119258.pdf"

E.Clapcote S. J.Broughton S. J.Dawson N.","Cereb Cortex",NA,"2p16.3 deletions involving heterozygous NEUREXIN1 (NRXN1) deletion dramatically increase the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia. We have little understanding of how NRXN1 heterozygosity increases the risk of developing these disorders particularly in terms of the impact on brain and neurotransmitter system function and brain network connectivity. Thus here we characterize cerebral metabolism and functional brain network connectivity in Nrxn1α heterozygous mice (Nrxn1α+/- mice) and assess the impact of ketamine and dextro-amphetamine on cerebral metabolism in these animals. We show that heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion alters cerebral metabolism in neural systems implicated in autism and schizophrenia including the thalamus mesolimbic system and select cortical regions. Nrxn1α heterozygosity also reduces the efficiency of functional brain networks through lost thalamic ""rich club"" and prefrontal cortex (PFC) hub connectivity and through reduced thalamic-PFC and thalamic ""rich club"" regional interconnectivity. Subanesthetic ketamine administration normalizes the thalamic hypermetabolism and partially normalizes thalamic disconnectivity present in Nrxn1α+/- mice while cerebral metabolic responses to dextro-amphetamine are unaltered. The data provide new insight into the systems-level impact of heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion and how this increases the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. The data also suggest that the thalamic dysfunction induced by heterozygous Nrxn1α deletion may be NMDA receptor-dependent.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078942962&doi=10.1093%2fcercor%2fbhz244&partnerID=40&md5=a0c923fa42ebe9faf71704795060ece0","Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences Faculty of Health and Medicine Lancaster University Lancaster LA1 4YQ UK.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSchool of Biomedical Sciences University of Leeds Leeds LS2 9JT UK.",2020,"10.1093/cercor/bhz244","Article","AnimalsCalcium-Binding Proteins/*geneticsDisease Models AnimalGene DeletionInjections IntraperitonealKetamine/*administration & dosageMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutMice TransgenicNerve Net/diagnostic imaging/drug effectsNeural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*geneticsNeurodevelopmental Disorders/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*geneticsPrefrontal Cortex/*diagnostic imaging/drug effectsThalamus/*diagnostic imaging/drug effectsNMDA receptorautismfunctional brain imaginggraph theoryschizophrenia","pubmed-31812984.pdf","pubmed-31812984","xml_texts/PMC7175007.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fcercor%2Fbhz244.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fcercor%2Fbhz244.pdf"

Characterization of the mechanisms that underlie PWS-associated hyperphagia has been slowed by the paucity of animal models with increased food intake or obesity. Mice with a microdeletion encompassing the Snord116 cluster of noncoding RNAs encoded within the Prader-Willi minimal deletion critical region have previously been reported to show growth retardation and hyperphagia. Here consistent with previous reports we observed growth retardation in Snord116+/-P mice with a congenital paternal Snord116 deletion. However these mice neither displayed increased food intake nor had reduced hypothalamic expression of the proprotein convertase 1 gene PCSK1 or its upstream regulator NHLH2 which have recently been suggested to be key mediators of PWS pathogenesis. Specifically we disrupted Snord116 expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus in Snord116fl mice via bilateral stereotaxic injections of a Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV). While the Cre-injected mice had no change in measured energy expenditure they became hyperphagic between 9 and 10 weeks after injection with a subset of animals developing marked obesity.

G.Claudianos C.","Plos one",NA,"Vertebrate studies show neuroligins and neurexins are binding partners in a trans-synaptic cell adhesion complex implicated in human autism and mental retardation disorders. Here we report a genetic analysis of homologous proteins in the honey bee. As in humans the honeybee has five large (31-246 kb up to 12 exons each) neuroligin genes three of which are tightly clustered. RNA analysis of the neuroligin-3 gene reveals five alternatively spliced transcripts generated through alternative use of exons encoding the cholinesterase-like domain. Whereas vertebrates have three neurexins the bee has just one gene named neurexin I (400 kb 28 exons). However alternative isoforms of bee neurexin I are generated by differential use of 12 splice sites mostly located in regions encoding LNS subdomains. Some of the splice variants of bee neurexin I resemble the vertebrate alpha- and beta-neurexins albeit in vertebrates these forms are generated by alternative promoters. Novel splicing variations in the 3' region generate transcripts encoding alternative trans-membrane and PDZ domains. Another 3' splicing variation predicts soluble neurexin I isoforms. Neurexin I and neuroligin expression was found in brain tissue with expression present throughout development and in most cases significantly up-regulated in adults. Transcripts of neurexin I and one neuroligin tested were abundant in mushroom bodies a higher order processing centre in the bee brain. We show neuroligins and neurexins comprise a highly conserved molecular system with likely similar functional roles in insects as vertebrates and with scope in the honeybee to generate substantial functional diversity through alternative splicing.

F.Chattarji S.Wood E. R.Wyllie D. J.Kind P. C.","Hum Mol Genet",NA,"Recent advances in techniques for manipulating genomes have allowed the generation of transgenic animals other than mice. These new models enable cross-mammalian comparison of neurological disease from core cellular pathophysiology to circuit and behavioural endophenotypes. Moreover they will enable us to directly test whether common cellular dysfunction or behavioural outcomes of a genetic mutation are more conserved across species. Using a new rat model of Fragile X Syndrome we report that Fmr1 knockout (KO) rats exhibit elevated basal protein synthesis and an increase in mGluR-dependent long-term depression in CA1 of the hippocampus that is independent of new protein synthesis. These defects in plasticity are accompanied by an increase in dendritic spine density selectively in apical dendrites and subtle changes in dendritic spine morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Behaviourally Fmr1 KO rats show deficits in hippocampal-dependent but not hippocampal-independent forms of associative recognition memory indicating that the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes defects in episodic-like memory. In contrast to previous reports from mice Fmr1 KO rats show no deficits in spatial reference memory reversal learning. One-trial spatial learning in a delayed matching to place water maze task was also not affected by the loss of FMRP in rats. This is the first evidence for conservation across mammalian species of cellular and physiological hippocampal phenotypes associated with the loss of FMRP. Furthermore while key cellular phenotypes are conserved they manifest in distinct behavioural dysfunction.

However how gut commensal bacteria modulate brain function in ASD remains unclear. Here we used chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) haploinsufficient mice as a model of ASD to elucidate the pathways through which the host and gut microbiota interact with each other. We found that increased levels of amino acid transporters in the intestines of the mouse model of ASD contribute to the high level of serum glutamine and the increased excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in the brain. In addition elevated α-defensin levels in the haploinsufficient mice resulted in dysregulation of the gut microbiota characterized by a reduced abundance of Bacteroides. Furthermore supplementation with Bacteroides uniformis improved the ASD-like behaviors and restored the E/I ratio in the brain by decreasing intestinal amino acid transport and the serum glutamine levels. Our study demonstrates associations between changes in the gut microbiota and amino acid transporters and ASD-like behavioral and electrophysiology phenotypes in a mouse model.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125691317&doi=10.1038%2fs41467-022-28746-2&partnerID=40&md5=47cf878304193e7b341e333d82d547f0","Beijing Institutes of Life Science Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rState Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rBeijing Institutes of Life Science Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China. zhfq@biols.ac.cn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China. zhfq@biols.ac.cn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKey Laboratory of Systems Biology Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Hangzhou China. zhfq@biols.ac.cn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rState Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents Institute of Zoology Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China. zhfq@biols.ac.cn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Excellence in Animal Evolution and Genetics Chinese Academy of Sciences Kunming China. zhfq@biols.ac.cn.",2022,"10.1038/s41467-022-28746-2","Article","Amino Acid Transport Systems/geneticsAnimals*Autism Spectrum Disorder/geneticsDisease Models Animal*Gastrointestinal Microbiome/geneticsGlutamineMice*Microbiota","pubmed-35241668.pdf","pubmed-35241668","xml_texts/PMC8894489.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-022-28746-2.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-022-28746-2.pdf"

E.","eNeuro",NA,"Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reln-signaling pathway and when either is deleted mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information Laminae I-II lateral Lamina V and the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN). Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here we ask whether the increased heat nociception in Reln and dab1 mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in Reln(-/-) and dab1(-/-) Laminae I-II than in their respective wild-type mice and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly heat stimulation in dab1(-/-) mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in Laminae I-II. Next we asked whether these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin saporin (SSP-SAP) eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of dab1(-/-) mice without altering their mechanical insensitivity.

"STDP and Mental Retardation: Dysregulation of Dendritic Excitability in Fragile X Syndrome","Meredith R. M.Mansvelder H. D.","Front Synaptic Neurosci",NA,"Development of cognitive function requires the formation and refinement of synaptic networks of neurons in the brain. Morphological abnormalities of synaptic spines occur throughout the brain in a wide variety of syndromic and non-syndromic disorders of mental retardation (MR). In both neurons from human post-mortem tissue and mouse models of retardation the changes observed in synaptic spine and dendritic morphology can be subtle in the range of 10-20% alterations for spine protrusion length and density. Functionally synapses in hippocampus and cortex show deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in an array of neurodevelopmental disorders including Down's Angelman Fragile X and Rett syndrome. Recent studies have shown that in principle the machinery for synaptic plasticity is in place in these synapses but that significant alterations in spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) induction rules exist in cortical synaptic pathways of Fragile X MR syndrome. In this model the threshold for inducing timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) is increased in these synapses. Increased postsynaptic activity can overcome this threshold and induce normal levels of tLTP. In this review we bring together recent studies investigating STDP in neurodevelopmental learning disorders using Fragile X syndrome as a model and we argue that alterations in dendritic excitability underlie deficits seen in STDP. Known and candidate dendritic mechanisms that may underlie the plasticity deficits are discussed. Studying STDP in monogenic MR syndromes with clear deficits in information processing at the cognitive level also provides the field with an opportunity to make direct links between cognition and processing rules at the synapse during development.",NA,"Department of Integrative Neurophysiology Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam VU University Amsterdam Netherlands.",2010,"10.3389/fnsyn.2010.00010","Article","Fragile X syndromeLtpStdpcalciumdendritedendritic excitabilitymental retardationspine","pubmed-21423496.pdf","pubmed-21423496","xml_texts/PMC3059693.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnsyn.2010.00010.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnsyn.2010.00010.pdf"
"Evidence that homozygous PTPRD gene microdeletion causes trigonocephaly, hearing loss, and intellectual disability","Choucair N., Mignon-Ravix C., Cacciagli P., Abou Ghoch J., Fawaz A., Mégarbané A., Villard L., Chouery E.","Molecular Cytogenetics",NA,"Background: The premature fusion of metopic sutures results in the clinical phenotype of trigonocephaly. An association of this characteristic with the monosomy 9p syndrome is well established and the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase gene (PTPRD), located in the 9p24.1p23 region and encoding a major component of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization, is considered as a good candidate to be responsible for this form of craniosynostosis. Moreover PTPRD is known to recruit multiple postsynaptic partners such as IL1RAPL1 which gene alterations lead to non syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Results: We describe a 30 month old boy with severe intellectual disability, trigonocephaly and dysmorphic facial features such as a midface hypoplasia, a flat nose, a depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism, a long philtrum and a drooping mouth. Microarray chromosomal analysis revealed the presence of a homozygous deletion involving the PTPRD gene, located on chromosome 9p22.3. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifications all along the gene failed to amplify the patient's cDNA in fibroblasts, indicating the presence of two null PTPRD alleles. Synaptic PTPRD interacts with IL1RAPL1 which defects have been associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder. The absence of the PTPRD transcript leads to a decrease in the expression of IL1RAPL1. These results suggest the direct involvement of PTPRD in ID, which is consistent with the PTPRD -/- mice phenotype. Deletions of PTPRD have been previously suggested as a cause of trigonocephaly in patients with monosomy 9p and genome-wide association study suggested variations in PTPRD are associated with hearing loss. Conclusions: The deletion identified in the reported patient supports previous hypotheses on its function in ID and hearing loss. However, its involvement in the occurrence of metopic synostosis is still to be discussed as more investigation of patients with the 9p monosomy syndrome is required. © 2015 Choucair et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84935826796&doi=10.1186%2fs13039-015-0149-0&partnerID=40&md5=cd403a16dae0d9a9a40d915f04081efb","Unité de Génétique Médicale et Laboratoire Associé INSERM à l'Unité UMR-S 910, Faculté de Médecine, Université Saint-Joseph, rue de Damas B.P. 17-5208 Mar Mikhael, Beyrouth, 11042020, Lebanon; Aix-Marseille Université, GMGF, Marseille, France; INSERM, UMR-S 910, Marseille, France; Département de Génétique Médicale, Assitance Publique Hôpitaux de Marseille, Hôpital d'Enfants de La Timone, Marseille, France; Neuropediatrics Department, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon; Institut Jérôme Lejeune, Paris, France",2015,"10.1186/s13039-015-0149-0","Article","complementary DNA; genomic DNA; protein tyrosine phosphatase; allele; Article; case report; child; craniofacial synostosis; cytogenetics; fibroblast; gene; gene amplification; gene deletion; genetic association; hearing impairment; homozygosity; human; hypertelorism; intellectual impairment; long philtrum; male; midface hypoplasia; monosomy; mutation; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; protein interaction; PTPRD gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Mus","scopus-84935826796.pdf","scopus-84935826796","xml_texts/PMC4469107.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13039-015-0149-0.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13039-015-0149-0.pdf"

The most commonly studied eusocial species honey bees and ants represent the behavioral extremes of social evolution but lack close relatives that are non-social. Unlike these species the halictid bee Lasioglossum albipes produces both solitary and eusocial nests and this intraspecific variation has a genetic basis. Here we identify genetic variants associated with this polymorphism including one located in the intron of syntaxin 1a (syx1a) a gene that mediates synaptic vesicle release. We show that this variant can alter gene expression in a pattern consistent with differences between social and solitary bees.

Recent human genetic studies however indicate that a clinical diagnosis with ASDAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is almost always associated with multiple genetic fore- and background changes. The translational value of animal model studies would be greatly enhanced if genetic insults could be studied in a more quantitative framework across genetic backgrounds. METHODS: We used the Collaborative Cross (CC) a novel mouse genetic reference population to investigate the quantitative genetic architecture of mouse behavioral phenotypes commonly used in animal models for NDD. RESULTS: Classical tests of social recognition and grooming phenotypes appeared insufficient for quantitative studies due to genetic dilution and limited heritability. In contrast digging locomotor activity and stereotyped exploratory patterns were characterized by continuous distribution across our CC sample and also mapped to quantitative trait loci containing genes associated with corresponding phenotypes in human populations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the CC can move animal model studies beyond comparative single gene-single background designs and point out which type of behavioral phenotypes are most suitable to quantify the effect of developmental etiologies across multiple genetic backgrounds.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058614049&doi=10.1186%2fs13229-018-0252-2&partnerID=40&md5=9057af6b830e7ea1e02ef64360bf0b7c","1Department of Translational Neuroscience Brain Center Rudolf Magnus University Medical Center Utrecht Universiteitsweg 100 3584 CG Utrecht The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r2Department of Psychiatry Brain Center Rudolf Magnus University Medical Center Utrecht Heidelberglaan 100 3584 CX Utrecht The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r3Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel Aviv University Ramat Aviv 69978 Tel Aviv Israel.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r4Genetics Institute University College London Gower Street London WC1E 6BT UK.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r5Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences University of Groningen Nijenborgh 7 9747 AG Groningen The Netherlands.",2018,"10.1186/s13229-018-0252-2","Article","AnimalsAutism Spectrum Disorder/*geneticsGenetics Behavioral/*methods/standardsGenome-Wide Association Study/*methods/standardsMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMultifactorial InheritanceQuantitative Trait LociReference StandardsAnimal modelsAutismBehavioral neuroscienceGenetic reference populationHistamine 3 receptorNeurodevelopmental disordersQuantitative geneticsRepetitive behavior","pubmed-30559955.pdf","pubmed-30559955","xml_texts/PMC6293525.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-018-0252-2.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-018-0252-2.pdf"

G.Dumas T. C.","Learn Mem",NA,"N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at excitatory synapses are central to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. NMDARs act as ionotropic and metabotropic receptors by elevating postsynaptic calcium concentrations and by direct intracellular protein signaling. In the forebrain these properties are controlled largely by the auxiliary GluN2 subunits GluN2A and GluN2B. While calcium conductance through NMDAR channels and intracellular protein signaling make separate contributions to synaptic plasticity it is not known if these properties individually influence learning and memory. To address this issue we created chimeric GluN2 subunits containing the amino-terminal domain and transmembrane domains from GluN2A or GluN2B fused to the carboxy-terminal domain of GluN2B (termed ABc) or GluN2A ATD (termed BAc) respectively and expressed these mutated GluN2 subunits in transgenic mice. Expression was confirmed at the mRNA level and protein subunit translation and translocation into dendrites were observed in forebrain neurons. In the spatial version of the Morris water maze BAc mice displayed signs of a learning deficit. In contrast ABc animals performed similarly to wild-types during training but showed a more direct approach to the goal location during a long-term memory test. There was no effect of ABc or BAc expression in a nonspatial water escape task. Since background expression is predominantly GluN2A in mature animals the results suggest that spatial learning is more sensitive to manipulations of the amino-terminal domain and transmembrane domains (calcium conductance) and long-term memory is regulated more by the carboxy-terminal domain (intracellular protein signaling).",NA,"Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study George Mason University Fairfax Virginia 22030 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPsychology Department George Mason University Fairfax Virginia 22030 USA.",2018,"10.1101/lm.047290.118","Article","Amino Acid SequenceAnimalsLearning Disabilities/metabolismMaze Learning/*physiologyMemory Disorders/metabolismMemory Long-Term/*physiologyMice TransgenicNeurons/metabolismProsencephalon/metabolismProtein DomainsRNA Messenger/metabolismReceptors N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics/*metabolismSpatial Behavior/physiology","pubmed-29764972.pdf","pubmed-29764972","xml_texts/PMC5959228.xml","full_texts/10.1101%2Flm.047290.118.txt","full_texts/10.1101%2Flm.047290.118.pdf"

A hallmark feature of NMDARs is an early postnatal developmental switch from those containing primarily GluN2B to primarily GluN2A subunits. Although the switch in phenotype has been an area of intense interest for two decades the mechanisms that trigger it and the link between experience and the switch are unclear. Here we show a new role for the transcriptional repressor REST in the developmental switch of synaptic NMDARs. REST is activated at a critical window of time and acts via epigenetic remodeling to repress Grin2b expression and alter NMDAR properties at rat hippocampal synapses. Knockdown of REST in vivo prevented the decline in GluN2B and developmental switch in NMDARs. Maternal deprivation impaired REST activation and acquisition of the mature NMDAR phenotype. Thus REST is essential for experience-dependent fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866731331&doi=10.1038%2fnn.3214&partnerID=40&md5=78670fd48561f8671e630a62b875f20c","Dominick P.

LNAA such as leucine are required for full activation of the mTOR-S6K signalling pathway promoting protein synthesis and cell growth. The SLC7A5 (LAT1) catalytic subunit of high-affinity System L1 functions as a glycoprotein-associated heterodimer with the multifunctional protein SLC3A2 (CD98). We generated a floxed Slc7a5 mouse strain which when crossed with mice expressing Cre driven by a global promoter produced Slc7a5 heterozygous knockout (Slc7a5(+/-)) animals with no overt phenotype although homozygous global knockout of Slc7a5 was embryonically lethal. Musclespecific (MCK Cre-mediated) Slc7a5 knockout (MS-Slc7a5-KO) mice were used to study the role of intracellular LNAA delivery by the SLC7A5 transporter for mTOR-S6K pathway activation in skeletal muscle. Activation of muscle mTOR-S6K (Thr389 phosphorylation) in vivo by intraperitoneal leucine injection was blunted in homozygous MS-Slc7a5-KO mice relative to wild-type animals.

In MS-Slc7a5-KO mice Leu and Ile concentrations in gastrocnemius muscle were reduced by similar to 40% as dietary protein content was reduced from 30 to 10%.

MS-Slc7a5-KO mice on 30% protein diet exhibited mild insulin resistance (e. g. reduced glucose clearance larger gonadal adipose depots) relative to control animals.

Indeed abnormalities in this major epigenetic mechanism play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficit and intellectual disability in humans. The most common cause of cognitive dysfunction in children is Down syndrome (DS). Since folate deficiency is very common among the pediatric population we questioned whether chronic folate deficiency (CFD) exacerbates cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of DS. To test this adult Ts65Dn mice and their disomic littermates were chronically fed a diet free of folic acid while preventing endogenous production of folate in the digestive tract for a period of 8 weeks. Our results show that the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS was significantly more vulnerable to CFD in terms of plasma homocysteine and N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) levels. Importantly these changes were linked to degenerative alterations in hippocampal dendritic morphology and impaired nest building behavior in Ts65Dn mice.

"Perinatal exposure to pesticides alters synaptic plasticity signaling and induces behavioral deficits associated with neurodevelopmental disorders","López-Merino E.Cuartero M. I.Esteban J. A.Briz V.","Cell Biol Toxicol",NA,"Increasing evidence from animal and epidemiological studies indicates that perinatal exposure to pesticides cause developmental neurotoxicity and may increase the risk for psychiatric disorders such as autism and intellectual disability. However the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain largely elusive. This work was aimed at testing the hypothesis that developmental exposure to different classes of pesticides hijacks intracellular neuronal signaling contributing to synaptic and behavioral alterations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Low concentrations of organochlorine (dieldrin endosulfan and chlordane) and organophosphate (chlorpyrifos and its oxon metabolite) pesticides were chronically dosed ex vivo (organotypic rat hippocampal slices) or in vivo (perinatal exposure in rats) and then biochemical electrophysiological behavioral and proteomic studies were performed. All the pesticides tested caused prolonged activation of MAPK/ERK pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally some of them impaired metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). In the case of the pesticide chlordane the effect was attributed to chronic modulation of MAPK/ERK signaling. These synaptic alterations were reproduced following developmental in vivo exposure to chlordane and chlorpyrifos-oxon and were also associated with prototypical behavioral phenotypes of NDD including impaired motor development increased anxiety and social and memory deficits. Lastly proteomic analysis revealed that these pesticides differentially regulate the expression of proteins in the hippocampus with pivotal roles in brain development and synaptic signaling some of which are associated with NDD. Based on these results we propose a novel mechanism of synaptic dysfunction involving chronic overactivation of MAPK and impaired mGluR-LTD shared by different pesticides which may have important implications for NDD.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124426052&doi=10.1007%2fs10565-022-09697-2&partnerID=40&md5=6978474031684ef031545d7f1728f459","Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM) Madrid Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeurovascular Pathophysiology Group Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) Madrid Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM) Madrid Spain. jaesteban@cbm.csic.es.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC-UAM) Madrid Spain. victor.briz@cbm.csic.es.",2022,"10.1007/s10565-022-09697-2","Article","ContaminantsKinase signalingMapkNeurodevelopmentPsychiatric disordersmGluR LTD","pubmed-35137321.pdf","pubmed-35137321","xml_texts/PMC10547633.xml","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs10565-022-09697-2.txt","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs10565-022-09697-2.pdf"

The reduction/absence of the functional FMRP protein coded by the X-linked Fmr1 gene in humans is responsible for the syndrome. Targets of FMRP CLSTN1 and ICAM5 play critical roles in the maturation of dendritic spines synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. However the implication of CLSTN1 and ICAM5 in dendritic spine abnormalities and the underlying neuropathologic processes in FXS remain uninvestigated. In this study we demonstrated that CLSTN1 co-localizes and co-transports with ICAM5 in cultured cortical neurons. Also we showed that shRNA-mediated downregulation of CLSTN1 in cultured WT neurons increases ICAM5 on the surface of synaptic membrane subsequently affecting the maturation of dendritic spines. Whereas normalization of CLSTN1 level in Fmr1 KO neurons reduces ICAM5 abundance and rescues impaired dendritic spine phenotypes. Most importantly CLSTN1 protein is reduced in the postnatal medial prefrontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice which is correlated with increased ICAM5 levels on the surface of synapses and excessive filopodia-like spines.

"A BDNF loop-domain mimetic acutely reverses spontaneous apneas and respiratory abnormalities during behavioral arousal in a mouse model of Rett syndrome","Kron M.Lang M.Adams I. T.Sceniak M.Longo F.Katz D. M.","Dis Model Mech",NA,"Reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome (RTT) a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). In Mecp2 mutant mice BDNF deficits have been associated with breathing abnormalities a core feature of RTT as well as with synaptic hyperexcitability within the brainstem respiratory network. Application of BDNF can reverse hyperexcitability in acute brainstem slices from Mecp2-null mice suggesting that therapies targeting BDNF or its receptor TrkB could be effective at acute reversal of respiratory abnormalities in RTT. Therefore we examined the ability of LM22A-4 a small-molecule BDNF loop-domain mimetic and TrkB partial agonist to modulate synaptic excitability within respiratory cell groups in the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS) and to acutely reverse abnormalities in breathing at rest and during behavioral arousal in Mecp2 mutants. Patch-clamp recordings in Mecp2-null brainstem slices demonstrated that LM22A-4 decreases excitability at primary afferent synapses in the nTS by reducing the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents and the frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. In vivo acute treatment of Mecp2-null and -heterozygous mutants with LM22A-4 completely eliminated spontaneous apneas in resting animals without sedation. Moreover we demonstrate that respiratory dysregulation during behavioral arousal a feature of human RTT is also reversed in Mecp2 mutants by acute treatment with LM22A-4. Together these data support the hypothesis that reduced BDNF signaling and respiratory dysfunction in RTT are linked and establish the proof-of-concept that treatment with a small-molecule structural mimetic of a BDNF loop domain and a TrkB partial agonist can acutely reverse abnormal breathing at rest and in response to behavioral arousal in symptomatic RTT mice.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907192606&doi=10.1242%2fdmm.016030&partnerID=40&md5=39d80eb93222b5e5820ce5f498123de0","Department of Neurosciences Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 10900 Euclid Avenue Cleveland OH 44106 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Stanford University School of Medicine 300 Pasteur Drive Stanford CA 94305 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurosciences Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 10900 Euclid Avenue Cleveland OH 44106 USA david.katz@case.edu.",2014,"10.1242/dmm.016030","Article","AnimalsApnea/*prevention & controlBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/chemistry/*physiologyCarbazoles/pharmacology*Disease Models AnimalHumansIndole Alkaloids/pharmacologyMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/geneticsMiceMice KnockoutProtein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology*RespirationRett Syndrome/*physiopathologyArousalBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)BrainstemMecp2Respiration","pubmed-25147297.pdf","pubmed-25147297","xml_texts/PMC4142725.xml","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.016030.txt","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.016030.pdf"

The heterogeneity of  in utero  opioid exposure, particularly exposure to polypharmacy, makes it difficult to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms that could inform early diagnosis and treatment of NOWS, and challenging to investigate consequences later in life. To address these issues, we developed a mouse model of NOWS that includes gestational and post-natal morphine exposure that encompasses the developmental equivalent of all three human trimesters and assessed both behavior and transcriptome alterations. Opioid exposure throughout all three human equivalent trimesters delayed developmental milestones and produced acute withdrawal phenotypes in mice reminiscent of those observed in infants. We also uncovered different patterns of gene expression depending on the duration and timing of opioid exposure (3-trimesters,  in utero  only, or the last trimester equivalent only). Opioid exposure and subsequent withdrawal affected social behavior and sleep in adulthood in a sex-dependent manner but did not affect adult behaviors related to anxiety, depression, or opioid response. Despite marked withdrawal and delays in development, long-term deficits in behaviors typically associated with substance use disorders were modest. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis revealed an enrichment for genes with altered expression in published datasets for Autism Spectrum Disorders, which correlate well with the deficits in social affiliation seen in our model. The number of differentially expressed genes between the NOWS and saline groups varied markedly based on exposure protocol and sex, but common pathways included synapse development, the GABAergic and myelin systems, and mitochondrial function.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37424750",NA,2023,"10.3389/fnbeh.2023.1202099","Article","behavior; brain transcriptome; mouse; neonatal; opioid; withdrawal","pubmed-37424750.pdf","pubmed-37424750","xml_texts/PMC10324024.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2023.1202099.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2023.1202099.pdf"

J.","Plos one",NA,"Psychiatric genetic studies have identified genome-wide significant loci for schizophrenia. The AKT3/1q44 locus is a principal risk region and gene-network analyses identify AKT3 polymorphisms as a constituent of several neurobiological pathways relevant to psychiatric risk; the neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. AKT3 shows prenatal enrichment during human neocortical development and recurrent copy number variations involving the 1q43-44 locus are associated with cortical malformations and intellectual disability implicating an essential role in early brain development. Here we investigated the role of AKT3 as it relates to aspects of learning and memory and behavioral function relevant to schizophrenia and cognitive disability utilizing a novel murine model of Akt3 genetic deficiency. Akt3 heterozygous (Akt3-/+) or null mice (Akt3-/-) were assessed in a comprehensive test battery. Brain biochemical studies were conducted to assess the impact of Akt3 deficiency on cortical Akt/mTOR signaling. Akt3-/+ and Akt3-/- mice exhibited selective deficits of temporal order discrimination and spatial memory tasks critically dependent on intact prefrontal-hippocampal circuitry but showed normal prepulse inhibition fear conditioned learning memory for novel objects and social function. Akt3 loss-of-function reduced brain size and dramatically impaired cortical Akt Ser473 activation in an allele-dose dependent manner. Such changes were observed in the absence of altered Akt1 or Akt2 protein expression. Concomitant reduction of the mTORC2 complex proteins Rictor and Sin1 identifies a potential mechanism. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurodevelopmental role of Akt3 identify a non-redundant role for Akt3 in the development of prefrontal cortical-mediated cognitive function and show that Akt3 is potentially the dominant regulator of AKT/mTOR signaling in brain.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018738443&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0175993&partnerID=40&md5=4007812919d210c35691beabc422b575","Department of Psychiatry School of Medicine University of Colorado Aurora Colorado United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Cell and Developmental Biology School of Medicine University of Colorado Aurora Colorado United States of America.",2017,"10.1371/journal.pone.0175993","Article","AnimalsConditioning ClassicalFearLearning Disabilities/*geneticsLocomotionMechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2Memory Disorders/*geneticsMiceMultiprotein Complexes/*metabolismProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolismSchizophrenia/*metabolism*Signal TransductionTOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism","pubmed-28467426.pdf","pubmed-28467426","xml_texts/PMC5414975.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0175993.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0175993.pdf"
"Modulation of corticospinal excitabilty by transcranial magnetic stimulation in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder","Oberman, LM; Pascual-Leone, A; Rotenberg, A","FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE",NA,"The developmental pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is currently not fully understood. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the behavioral phenotype may result from dysfunctional inhibitory control over excitatory synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this claim, previous studies indicate that adults with Asperger's Syndrome show an abnormally extended modulation of corticospinal excitability following a train of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). As ASD is a developmental disorder, the current study aimed to explore the effect of development on the duration of modulation of corticospinal excitability in children and adolescents with ASD. Additionally, as the application of rTMS to the understanding and treatment of pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders is an emerging field, this study further sought to provide evidence for the safety and tolerability of rTMS in children and adolescents with ASD. Corticospinal excitability was measured by applying single pulses of TMS to the primary motor cortex both before and following a 40 s train of continuous theta burst stimulation. 19 high-functioning males ages 9-18 with ASD participated in this study. Results from this study reveal a positive linear relationship between age and duration of modulation of rTMS aftereffects. Specifically we found that the older participants had a longer lasting response. Furthermore, though the specific protocol employed typically suppresses corticospinal excitability in adults, more than one third of our sample had a paradoxical facilitatory response to the stimulation. Results support the safety and tolerability of rTMS in pediatric clinical populations.

Although the establishment of appropriate numbers of these cells is essential for brain function and behaviour our understanding of this fundamental process is limited. Here we show that the survival of interneurons in mice depends on the activity of pyramidal cells in a critical window of postnatal development during which excitatory synaptic input to individual interneurons predicts their survival or death. Pyramidal cells regulate interneuron survival through the negative modulation of PTEN signalling which effectively drives interneuron cell death during this period. Our findings indicate that activity-dependent mechanisms dynamically adjust the number of inhibitory cells in nascent local cortical circuits ultimately establishing the appropriate proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048297127&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-018-0139-6&partnerID=40&md5=e03d6681411e01f91b0f49ec33f15d17","Centre for Developmental Neurobiology Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience King's College London London UK.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMedical Research Council Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders King's College London London UK.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentre for Developmental Neurobiology Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience King's College London London UK. oscar.marin@kcl.ac.uk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMedical Research Council Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders King's College London London UK. oscar.marin@kcl.ac.uk.",2018,"10.1038/s41586-018-0139-6","Article","AnimalsCell CountCell DeathCell SurvivalCerebral Cortex/*cytology/*physiologyFemaleInterneurons/*cytology/physiologyMaleMice*Neural PathwaysPTEN Phosphohydrolase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolismPyramidal Cells/*physiology","pubmed-29849154.pdf","pubmed-29849154","xml_texts/PMC6207348.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0139-6.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0139-6.pdf"

E.","Front Mol Neurosci",NA,"The small GTPase Rac1 promotes actin polymerization and plays a critical and increasingly appreciated role in the development and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of the Rac1 signaling pathway at glutamatergic synapses contributes to Autism Spectrum Disorder/intellectual disability (ASD/ID)-related behaviors seen in animal models of ASD/ID. Rac1 has also been proposed as a strong candidate of convergence for many factors implicated in the development of ASD/ID. However the effects of ASD/ID-related mutations in Rac1 itself have not been explored in neurons. Here we investigate a recently reported de novo missense mutation in Rac1 found in an individual with severe ID. Our modeling predicts that this mutation will strongly inhibit Rac1 activation by occluding Rac1's GTP binding pocket. Indeed we find that this de novo mutation prevents Rac1 function and results in a selective reduction in synaptic AMPA receptor function. Furthermore this mutation prevents the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) the cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory formation. Together our findings strongly suggest that this mutation contributes to the development of ID in this individual.

Our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that CA repeats are key mediators of MeCP2 function.

It is characterized by distinctive facial features brachydactyly sleep disturbances and stereotypic behaviors. METHODS: We investigated a cohort of 15 individuals with a clinical suspicion of SMS who showed neither deletion in the SMS critical region nor damaging variants in RAI1 using whole exome sequencing. A combination of network analysis (co-expression and biomedical text mining) transcriptomics and circularized chromatin conformation capture (4C-seq) was applied to verify whether modified genes are part of the same disease network as known SMS-causing genes. RESULTS: Potentially deleterious variants were identified in nine of these individuals using whole-exome sequencing. Eight of these changes affect KMT2D ZEB2 MAP2K2 GLDC CASK MECP2 KDM5C and POGZ known to be associated with Kabuki syndrome 1 Mowat-Wilson syndrome cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome glycine encephalopathy mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia X-linked mental retardation 13 X-linked mental retardation Claes-Jensen type and White-Sutton syndrome respectively. The ninth individual carries a de novo variant in JAKMIP1 a regulator of neuronal translation that was recently found deleted in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. Analyses of co-expression and biomedical text mining suggest that these pathologies and SMS are part of the same disease network. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained from transcriptome profiling that showed that the expression levels of both Zeb2 and Map2k2 are perturbed in Rai1 (-/-) mice. As an orthogonal approach to potentially contributory disease gene variants we used chromatin conformation capture to reveal chromatin contacts between RAI1 and the loci flanking ZEB2 and GLDC as well as between RAI1 and human orthologs of the genes that show perturbed expression in our Rai1 (-/-) mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These holistic studies of RAI1 and its interactions allow insights into SMS and other disorders associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities.

The classical Type II cadherins cadherin-8 (Cdh8 CDH8) and cadherin-11 (Cdh11 CDH11) have been implicated as autism risk gene candidates. To explore the role of cadherins in the etiology of autism we investigated their expression patterns during mouse brain development and in autism-specific human tissue. In mice expression of cadherin-8 and cadherin-11 was developmentally regulated and enriched in the cortex hippocampus and thalamus/striatum during the peak of dendrite formation and synaptogenesis. Both cadherins were expressed in synaptic compartments but only cadherin-8 associated with the excitatory synaptic marker neuroligin-1. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neural precursor cells (NPCs) and cortical organoids generated from individuals with autism showed upregulated CDH8 expression levels but downregulated CDH11. We used Cdh11 knock-out (KO) mice of both sexes to analyze the function of cadherin-11 which could help explain phenotypes observed in autism. Cdh11(-/-) hippocampal neurons exhibited increased dendritic complexity along with altered neuronal and synaptic activity. Similar to the expression profiles in human tissue levels of cadherin-8 were significantly elevated in Cdh11 KO brains. Additionally excitatory synaptic markers neuroligin-1 and postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 were both increased. Together these results strongly suggest that cadherin-11 is involved in regulating the development of neuronal circuitry and that alterations in the expression levels of cadherin-11 may contribute to the etiology of autism.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109168445&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0066-21.2021&partnerID=40&md5=efe8d24f84c06f2c810ad6b6380f74e2","Program in Neuroscience Hussman Institute for Autism Baltimore MD 21201 jfrei@hussmanautism.org yclin@hussmanautism.org.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rProgram in Neuroscience Hussman Institute for Autism Baltimore MD 21201.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKey Laboratory of Brain Functional Genomics (Ministry of Education and Shanghai) Institute of Brain Functional Genomics School of Life Science and the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science East China Normal University Shanghai 200062 People's Republic of China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rJohn P.

W.Sarachana T.","Sci Rep",NA,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder inexplicably biased towards males. Although prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has recently been associated with the ASD risk whether BPA dysregulates ASD-related genes in the developing brain remains unclear. In this study transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi isolated from neonatal pups prenatally exposed to BPA was conducted and revealed a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ASD. Among the DEGs several ASD candidate genes including Auts2 and Foxp2 were dysregulated and showed sex differences in response to BPA exposure. The interactome and pathway analyses of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed significant associations between the DEGs in males and neurological functions/disorders associated with ASD. Moreover the reanalysis of transcriptome profiling data from previously published BPA studies consistently showed that BPA-responsive genes were significantly associated with ASD-related genes. The findings from this study indicate that prenatal BPA exposure alters the expression of ASD-linked genes in the hippocampus and suggest that maternal BPA exposure may increase ASD susceptibility by dysregulating genes associated with neurological functions known to be negatively impacted in ASD which deserves further investigations.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062282034&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-39386-w&partnerID=40&md5=e9538d2aa7f0299722b10a1af08d2f56","The Ph.D. Program in Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine Department of Clinical Chemistry Faculty of Allied Health Sciences Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Anatomy Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAge-related Inflammation and Degeneration Research Unit Department of Clinical Chemistry Faculty of Allied Health Sciences Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences The George Washington University Washington DC USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAge-related Inflammation and Degeneration Research Unit Department of Clinical Chemistry Faculty of Allied Health Sciences Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand. tewarit.sa@chula.ac.th.",2019,"10.1038/s41598-019-39386-w","Article","AnimalsAnimals NewbornAutism Spectrum Disorder/chemically induced/*genetics/pathologyBenzhydryl Compounds/*toxicityDisease Models AnimalFemaleForkhead Transcription Factors/metabolismGene Expression Regulation Developmental/*drug effectsHippocampus/*drug effects/pathologyHumansMalePhenols/*toxicityPregnancyPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/*genetics/pathologyRNA-SeqRatsSex Factors","pubmed-30816183.pdf","pubmed-30816183","xml_texts/PMC6395584.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-39386-w.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-39386-w.pdf"

While various genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated in ASD, this review aims to provide an overview of studies elucidating the mechanisms by which gut microbiota, associated metabolites, and the brain interact to influence behavior and ASD development, in at least a subgroup of individuals with gastrointestinal problems. Specifically, we review the brain-gut-microbiome system and discuss findings from current animal and human studies as they relate to social-behavioral and neurological impairments in ASD, microbiota-targeted therapies (i.e., probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation) in ASD, and how microbiota may influence the brain at molecular, structural, and functional levels, with a particular interest in social and emotion-related brain networks.

Previous studies showed that mice expressing a mutant KRAS have impaired the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory neurons which may contribute to behavioural deficits in the mutant mice. However the underlying cellular mechanisms and the role of excitatory neurons in these behavioural deficits in adults are not fully understood. Herein we report that neuron type-specific expression of a constitutively active mutant KRAS(G12V) in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons resulted in spatial memory deficits in adult mice. In inhibitory neurons KRAS(G12V) induced ERK activation and enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission. Expressing KRAS(G12V) in inhibitory neurons also impaired long-term potentiation in the hippocampal Shaffer-collateral pathway which could be rescued by picrotoxin treatment. In contrast KRAS(G12V) induced ERK activation and neuronal cell death in excitatory neurons which might have contributed to the severe behavioural deficits.

It is generally assumed that this increase in COMT activity influences cognitive function and psychiatric disease risk by increasing dopamine turnover in cortical synapses though this cannot be directly measured in humans. Here we explore a novel transgenic mouse model of increased COMT activity equivalent to the relative increase in activity observed with the human COMT Val(158) allele. By performing an extensive battery of behavioral tests we found that COMT overexpressing mice (COMT-OE mice) exhibit cognitive deficits selectively in the domains that are affected by the COMT Val(158) allele stimulus-response learning and working memory functionally validating our model of increased COMT activity. Although we detected no changes in the level of markers for dopamine synthesis and dopamine transport we found that COMT-OE mice display an increase in dopamine release capacity in the striatum. This result suggests that increased COMT activity may not only affect dopamine signaling by enhancing synaptic clearance in the cortex but may also cause changes in presynaptic dopamine function in the striatum.

However we report in this paper that loss of TSC in the adult Drosophila midgut results in the formation of much larger ISCs that have halted cell division. These mutant ISCs expressed proper stem cell markers did not differentiate and had defects in multiple steps of the cell cycle. Slowing the growth by feeding rapamycin or reducing Myc was sufficient to rescue the division defect. The TSC mutant guts had a thinner epithelial structure than wild-type tissues and the mutant flies were more susceptible to tissue damage.

Although the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder is unknown being overweight or obesity during infancy and low weight at birth are known as risks suggesting a metabolic aspect. In this study we investigated adipose tissue development as a pathophysiological factor of autism spectrum disorder by examining the serum levels of adipokines and other metabolic markers in autism spectrum disorder children (n = 123) and typically developing children (n = 92) at 4-12 years of age. Among multiple measures exhibiting age-dependent trajectories the leptin levels displayed different trajectory patterns between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children supporting an adipose tissue-dependent mechanism of autism spectrum disorder. Of particular interest the levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) were significantly lower in autism spectrum disorder children than in typically developing subjects at preschool age (4-6 years old: n = 21 for autism spectrum disorder and n = 26 for typically developing). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis discriminated autism spectrum disorder children from typically developing children with a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 75.0%. We re-sequenced the exons of the FABP4 gene in a Japanese cohort comprising 659 autism spectrum disorder and 1000 control samples and identified two rare functional variants in the autism spectrum disorder group. The Trp98Stop one of the two variants was transmitted to the proband from his mother with a history of depression. The disruption of the Fabp4 gene in mice evoked autism spectrum disorder-like behavioural phenotypes and increased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons which has been observed in the postmortem brains of autism spectrum disorder subjects. The Fabp4 knockout mice had an altered fatty acid composition in the cortex. Collectively these results suggest that an 'adipo-brain axis' may underlie the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder with FABP4 as a potential molecule for use as a biomarker.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100929557&doi=10.1093%2fbraincomms%2ffcaa145&partnerID=40&md5=9d368fd2fde3c78d22c7291b4d9c9cf9","Laboratory for Molecular Psychiatry RIKEN Center for Brain Science Saitama Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Public Health Faculty of Medicine University of Toyama Toyama Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hamamatsu University School of Medicine Shizuoka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rResearch Center for Child Mental Development Hamamatsu University School of Medicine Shizuoka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Hirosaki University School of Medicine Aomori Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry and Neurology Fukude Nishi Hospital Shizuoka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Rehabilitation Miyagi Children's Hospital Miyagi Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Clinical Pharmacology Faculty of Medicine Oita University Oita Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSchool of Contemporary Sociology Chukyo University Aichi Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rResearch Center for Child Mental Development University of Fukui Fukui Japan.",2020,"10.1093/braincomms/fcaa145","Article","adipose tissueearly childhoodearly diagnostic biomarkerfunctional variantspolyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)","pubmed-33225276.pdf","pubmed-33225276","xml_texts/PMC7667725.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa145.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa145.pdf"

The hearing deficits in ASD range from deafness to extreme sensitivity to routine environmental sounds.

However in our study of the human SOC we failed to find any changes in the total number of neurons in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) or any changes in cell body size or shape. Similarly in animals prenatally exposed to the antiepileptic valproic acid (VPA) we failed to find any changes in the total number size or shape of VNTB neurons. Based on these findings we hypothesized that the neurotransmitter profiles ascending and descending axonal projections of the VNTB are also preserved in these neurodevelopmental conditions. We investigated this hypothesis using a combination of immunohistochemistry and retrograde tract tracing. We found no difference between control and VPA-exposed animals in the number of VNTB neurons immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Additionally we investigated the ascending projections from the VNTB to both the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) and medial geniculate (MG) and descending projections to the cochlea. Our results indicate no significant differences in the ascending and descending projections from the VNTB between control and VPA-exposed animals despite drastic changes in these projections from surrounding nuclei.

Recently accumulating evidence involving mutation analysis cellular assays and mouse models has suggested that neuroligin (NLGN) mutations affect synapse maturation and function.

METHODS: In this study we analyzed the functional effect of these missense variations by in vitro experiment via the stable HEK293 cells expressing wild-type and mutant neuroligin. RESULTS: We found that the four mutations did not significantly impair the expression of neuroligin 3 and neuroligin 4X and also did not measurably inhibit the neurexin 1-neuroligin interaction.

We found that IL1RAPL1 regulates synapse formation of cortical neurons. To investigate how IL1RAPL1 controls synapse formation we here screened IL1RAPL1-interacting proteins by affinity chromatography and mass spectroscopy. IL1RAPL1 interacted with Mcf2-like (Mcf2l) a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor through the cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor domain. Knockdown of endogenous Mcf2l and treatment with an inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) the downstream kinase of RhoA suppressed IL1RAPL1-induced excitatory synapse formation of cortical neurons. Furthermore we found that the expression of IL1RAPL1 affected the turnover of AMPA receptor subunits.

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to recapitulate the most common mutation, E122K, in mice. Although E122K heterozygotes were not observed to have convulsive seizures, they exhibited frequent electrographic seizures and EEG abnormalities, transient early motor deficits and growth defects. Both E122K homozygotes and Eef1a2-null mice developed progressive motor abnormalities, with E122K homozygotes reaching humane endpoints by P31. The null phenotype is driven by progressive spinal neurodegeneration; however, no signs of neurodegeneration were observed in E122K homozygotes. The E122K protein was relatively stable in neurons yet highly unstable in skeletal myocytes, suggesting that the E122K/E122K phenotype is instead driven by loss of function in muscle. Nevertheless, motor abnormalities emerged far earlier in E122K homozygotes than in nulls, suggesting a toxic gain of function and/or a possible dominant-negative effect.

"Cognitive dysfunction in NF1 knock-out mice may result from altered vesicular trafficking of APP/DRD3 complex","Donarum E. A., Halperin R. F., Stephan D. A., Narayanan V.","BMC Neurosci",NA,"BACKGROUND: It has been estimated that more than 50% of patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have neurobehavioral impairments which include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder visual/spatial learning disabilities and a myriad of other cognitive developmental problems. The biological mechanisms by which NF1 gene mutations lead to such cognitive deficits are not well understood although excessive Ras signaling and increased GABA mediated inhibition have been implicated. It is proposed that the cognitive deficits in NF1 are the result of dysfunctional cellular trafficking and localization of molecules downstream of the primary gene defect. RESULTS: To elucidate genes involved in the pathogenic process gene expression analysis was performed comparing the expression profiles in various brain regions for control and Nf1+/- heterozygous mice. Gene expression analysis was performed for hippocampal samples dissected from postnatal day 10 15 and 20 mice utilizing the Affymetrix Mouse Genome chip (Murine 430 2.0). Analysis of expression profiles between Nf1+/- and wild-type animals was focused on the hippocampus because of previous studies demonstrating alterations in hippocampal LTP in the Nf1+/- mice and the region's importance in visual/spatial learning. Network analysis identified links between neurofibromin and kinesin genes which were down regulated in the Nf1+/- mice at postnatal days 15 and 20. CONCLUSION: Through this analysis it is proposed that neurofibromin forms a binding complex with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and through filamin proteins interacts with a dopamine receptor (Drd3). Though the effects of these interactions are not yet known this information may provide novel ideas about the pathogenesis of cognitive defects in NF1 and may facilitate the development of novel targeted therapeutic interventions.",NA,NA,2006,"10.1186/1471-2202-7-22","Article",NA,"pubmed-16524466.pdf","pubmed-16524466","xml_texts/PMC1434756.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2F1471-2202-7-22.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2F1471-2202-7-22.pdf"

We then evaluate the Hebb-Williams maze paradigm (Hebb and Williams 1946; Rabinovitch and Rosvold 1951) on the basis of these criteria using Fragile X syndrome (FXS) as model disease. We focused on this paradigm because it allows direct comparison of humans and animals on tasks that are behaviorally equivalent (criterion #1) and because it measures spatial information processing a cognitive domain for which FXS individuals and mice show impairments as compared to controls (criterion #2). We directly compared the performance of affected humans and mice across different experimental conditions and measures of behavior to identify which conditions produce comparable patterns of results in both species. Species differences were negligible for Mazes 2 4 and 5 irrespective of the presence of visual cues suggesting that these mazes could be used to measure spatial learning in both species. With regards to performance on the first trial which reflects visuo-spatial problem solving Mazes 5 and 9 without visual cues produced the most consistent results. We conclude that the Hebb-Williams mazes paradigm has the potential to be utilized in translational research to measure comparable cognitive functions in FXS humans and animals (criterion #3).",NA,NA,2018,"10.3389/fnmol.2018.00099","Article",NA,"wos-000428560600001.pdf","wos-000428560600001","xml_texts/PMC5882825.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00099.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00099.pdf"

Foundational studies have defined an array of behavioral phenotypes in the AS mouse model. However no single behavioral test is able to fully capture the complex nature of AS-in mice or in children. We performed multidimensional analysis (principal component analysis + k-means clustering) to quantify the performance of AS model mice (n = 148) and wild-type littermates (n = 138) across eight behavioral domains. This approach correctly predicted the genotype of mice based on their behavioral profile with ~95% accuracy and remained effective with reasonable sample sizes (n = ~12-15). Multidimensional analysis was effective using different combinations of behavioral inputs and was able to detect behavioral improvement as a function of treatment in AS model mice. Overall multidimensional behavioral analysis provides a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of preclinical treatments for AS.

How neuronal plasma membrane proteins, including cell adhesion molecules, cycle between early endosomes and the plasma membrane is poorly understood. Here we show that the  Drosophila  homolog of the chromatin remodeling enzymes CHD7 and CHD8, Kismet, represses the synaptic levels of several cell adhesion molecules. Neuroligins 1 and 3 and the integrins αPS2 and βPS are increased at  kismet  mutant synapses but Kismet only directly regulates transcription of  neuroligin 2 . Kismet may therefore regulate synaptic CAMs indirectly by activating transcription of gene products that promote intracellular vesicle trafficking including  endophilin B  ( endoB ) and/or  rab11 . Knock down of EndoB in all tissues or neurons increases synaptic FasII while knock down of EndoB in  kis  mutants does not produce an additive increase in FasII. In contrast, neuronal expression of Rab11, which is deficient in  kis  mutants, leads to a further increase in synaptic FasII in  kis  mutants.

"Functional and structural specific roles of activity-driven BDNF within circuits formed by single spiny stellate neurons of the barrel cortex","Sun Q. Q.Zhang Z.Sun J.Nair A. S.Petrus D. P.Zhang C.","Front Cell Neurosci",NA,"Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays key roles in several neurodevelopmental disorders and actions of pharmacological treatments. However it is unclear how specific BDNF's effects are on different circuit components. Current studies have largely focused on the role of BDNF in modification of synaptic development. The precise roles of BDNF in the refinement of a functional circuit in vivo remain unclear. Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF may be associated with increased risk for cognitive impairments and is mediated at least in part by activity-dependent trafficking and/or secretion of BDNF. Using mutant mice that lacked activity-driven BDNF expression (bdnf-KIV) we previously reported that experience regulation of the cortical GABAergic network is mediated by activity-driven BDNF expression. Here we demonstrate that activity-driven BDNF's effects on circuits formed by the layer IV spiny stellate cells are highly specific. Structurally dendritic but not axonal morphology was altered in the mutant. Physiologically GABAergic but not glutamatergic synapses were severely affected. The effects on GABA transmission occurs via presynaptic alteration of calcium-dependent release probability. These results suggest that neuronal activity through activity-driven BDNF expression can selectively regulate specific features of layer IV circuits in vivo. We postulate that the role of activity-dependent BDNF is to modulate the computational ability of circuits that relate to the gain control (i.e. feed-forward inhibition); whereas the basic wiring of circuits relevant to the sensory pathway is spared. Gain control modulation within cortical circuits has broad impact on cognitive processing and brain state-transitions. Cognitive behavior and mode is determined by brain states thus the studying of circuit alteration by endogenous BDNF provides insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of diseases mediated by BDNF.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908645020&doi=10.3389%2ffncel.2014.00372&partnerID=40&md5=71176b547a439a11e4d44e06e8b82d6b","Department of Zoology and Physiology University of Wyoming Laramie WY USA.",2014,"10.3389/fncel.2014.00372","Article","axonal arborizationsdendritic spineneurotrophinpresynapticvariance–mean analysis","pubmed-25414642.pdf","pubmed-25414642","xml_texts/PMC4222225.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2014.00372.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2014.00372.pdf"

Mytho is significantly up-regulated in various mouse models of skeletal muscle atrophy. Short term depletion of MYTHO in mice attenuates muscle atrophy caused by fasting, denervation, cancer cachexia and sepsis. While MYTHO overexpression is sufficient to trigger muscle atrophy, MYTHO knockdown results in a progressive increase in muscle mass associated with a sustained activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Prolonged MYTHO knockdown is associated with severe myopathic features, including impaired autophagy, muscle weakness, myofiber degeneration, and extensive ultrastructural defects, such as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and tubular aggregates. Inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling pathway in mice using rapamycin treatment attenuates the myopathic phenotype triggered by MYTHO knockdown. Skeletal muscles from human patients diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) display reduced Mytho expression, activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and impaired autophagy, raising the possibility that low Mytho expression might contribute to the progression of the disease.

"CELF4 regulates translation and local abundance of a vast set of mRNAs including genes associated with regulation of synaptic function","Wagnon J. L.Briese M.Sun W.Mahaffey C. L.Curk T.Rot G.Ule J.Frankel W. N.","PLoS Genet",NA,"RNA-binding proteins have emerged as causal agents of complex neurological diseases. Mice deficient for neuronal RNA-binding protein CELF4 have a complex neurological disorder with epilepsy as a prominent feature. Human CELF4 has recently been associated with clinical features similar to those seen in mutant mice. CELF4 is expressed primarily in excitatory neurons including large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and it regulates excitatory but not inhibitory neurotransmission. We examined mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability in Celf4 mutants by identifying CELF4 target mRNAs and assessing their fate in the absence of CELF4 in view of their known functions. CELF4 binds to at least 15%-20% of the transcriptome with striking specificity for the mRNA 3' untranslated region. CELF4 mRNA targets encode a variety of proteins many of which are well established in neuron development and function. While the overall abundance of these mRNA targets is often dysregulated in Celf4 deficient mice the actual expression changes are modest at the steady-state level. In contrast by examining the transcriptome of polysome fractions and the mRNA distribution along the neuronal cell body-neuropil axis we found that CELF4 is critical for maintaining mRNA stability and availability for translation.

Together with a related study of the impact of CELF4 loss on sodium channel Na(v)1.6 function we suggest that CELF4 deficiency leads to abnormal neuronal function by combining a specific effect on neuronal excitation with a general impairment of synaptic transmission.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and accordingly treatment with GABA-A antagonists can efficiently restore cognitive functions of Ts65Dn mice a genetic model for DS. However GABA-A antagonists are also convulsant which preclude their use for therapeutic intervention in DS individuals. Here we have evaluated safer strategies to release GABAergic inhibition using a GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist selective for the α5-subtype (α5IA). We demonstrate that α5IA restores learning and memory functions of Ts65Dn mice in the novel-object recognition and in the Morris water maze tasks. Furthermore we show that following behavioural stimulation α5IA enhances learning-evoked immediate early gene products in specific brain regions involved in cognition. Importantly acute and chronic treatments with α5IA do not induce any convulsant or anxiogenic effects that are associated with GABA-A antagonists or non-selective inverse agonists of the GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptors. Finally chronic treatment with α5IA did not induce histological alterations in the brain liver and kidney of mice.

"Restoration of motor learning in a mouse model of Rett syndrome following long-term treatment with a novel small-molecule activator of TrkB","Adams I.Yang T.Longo F. M.Katz D. M.","Dis Model Mech",NA,"Reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and impaired activation of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB; also known as Ntrk2) are thought to contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome (RTT) a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that enhancing BDNF expression and/or TrkB activation in Mecp2-deficient mouse models of RTT can ameliorate or reverse abnormal neurological phenotypes that mimic human RTT symptoms. The present study reports on the preclinical efficacy of a novel small-molecule non-peptide TrkB partial agonist PTX-BD4-3 in heterozygous female Mecp2 mutant mice a well-established RTT model that recapitulates the genetic mosaicism of the human disease. PTX-BD4-3 exhibited specificity for TrkB in cell-based assays of neurotrophin receptor activation and neuronal cell survival and in in vitro receptor binding assays. PTX-BD4-3 also activated TrkB following systemic administration to wild-type and Mecp2 mutant mice and was rapidly cleared from the brain and plasma with a half-life of ∼2 h. Chronic intermittent treatment of Mecp2 mutants with a low dose of PTX-BD4-3 (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally once every 3 days for 8 weeks) reversed deficits in two core RTT symptom domains - respiration and motor control - and symptom rescue was maintained for at least 24 h after the last dose. Together these data indicate that significant clinically relevant benefit can be achieved in a mouse model of RTT with a chronic intermittent low-dose treatment paradigm targeting the neurotrophin receptor TrkB.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099076485&doi=10.1242%2fdmm.044685&partnerID=40&md5=7fe13c6f87a8707326076646d199bcf5","Department of Neurosciences Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 10900 Euclid Avenue Cleveland OH 44106-4975 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Stanford University School of Medicine Stanford CA 94305 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurosciences Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 10900 Euclid Avenue Cleveland OH 44106-4975 USA david.katz@case.edu.",2020,"10.1242/dmm.044685","Article","AnimalsCell Survival/drug effectsDisease Models AnimalFemaleHeterozygoteHippocampus/pathologyMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolismMice Mutant Strains*Motor Activity/drug effectsNeurons/drug effects/metabolism/pathologyReceptor trkB/*metabolismRett Syndrome/blood/pathology/*physiopathologySignal Transduction/drug effectsSmall Molecule Libraries/chemistry/*pharmacologyBrain-derived neurotrophic factorMecp2Neuro-rehabilitationRespiration","pubmed-33361117.pdf","pubmed-33361117","xml_texts/PMC7710018.xml","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.044685.txt","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.044685.pdf"
"The Bidirectional Social-Cognitive Mechanisms of the Social-Attention Symptoms of Autism","Mundy P.Bullen J.","Front Psychiatry",NA,"Differences in social attention development begin to be apparent in the 6(th) to 12(th) month of development in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and theoretically reflect important elements of its neurodevelopmental endophenotype. This paper examines alternative conceptual views of these early social attention symptoms and hypotheses about the mechanisms involved in their development. One model emphasizes mechanism involved in the spontaneous allocation of attention to faces or social orienting. Alternatively another model emphasizes mechanisms involved in the coordination of attention with other people or joint attention and the socially bi-directional nature of its development. This model raises the possibility that atypical responses of children to the attention or the gaze of a social partner directed toward themselves may be as important in the development of social attention symptoms as differences in the development of social orienting. Another model holds that symptoms of social attention may be important to early development but may not impact older individuals with ASD. The alterative model is that the social attention symptoms in infancy (social orienting and joint attention) and social cognitive symptoms in childhood and adulthood share common neurodevelopmental substrates. Therefore differences in early social attention and later social cognition constitute a developmentally continuous axis of symptom presentation in ASD. However symptoms in older individuals may be best measured with in vivo measures of efficiency of social attention and social cognition in social interactions rather than the accuracy of response on analog tests used in measures with younger children. Finally a third model suggests that the social attention symptoms may not truly be a symptom of ASD. Rather they may be best conceptualized as stemming from differences domain general attention and motivation mechanisms. The alternative argued for here that infant social attention symptoms meet all the criteria of a unique dimension of the phenotype of ASD and the bi-directional phenomena involved in social attention cannot be fully explained in terms of domain general aspects of attention development.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124613078&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyt.2021.752274&partnerID=40&md5=ec7a477ee3c0d11904c47c68704dc3f9","Department of Learning and Mind Sciences School of Education University of California Davis Davis CA United States.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science and The MIND Institute UC Davis School of Medicine Sacramento CA United States.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Human Development School of Human Ecology University of California Davis Davis CA United States.",2021,"10.3389/fpsyt.2021.752274","Article","diagnosisface processinggeneticsinterventionjoint attentionsocial motivationsocial orientingsocial-cognitive neuroscience","pubmed-35173636.pdf","pubmed-35173636","xml_texts/PMC8841840.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2021.752274.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2021.752274.pdf"

Here, we provide a mouse model of Say-Barber-Biesecker- Young-Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS) (OMIM 603736) and demonstrate proof-of-principle efficacy of postnatal treatment. SBBYSS results from heterozygous mutations in the KAT6B (MYST4/MORF/QFK) gene and is characterized by intellectual disability and autism-like behaviors. Using human cells carrying SBBYSS-specific KAT6B mutations and Kat6b heterozygous mice (Kat6b), we showed that KAT6B deficiency caused a reduction in histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation. Kat6b mice displayed learning, memory, and social deficits, mirroring SBBYSS individuals. Treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid, or an acetyl donor, acetyl-carnitine (ALCAR), elevated histone acetylation levels in the human cells with SBBYSS mutations and in brain and blood cells of Kat6b mice and partially reversed gene expression changes in Kat6b cortical neurons. Both compounds improved sociability in Kat6b mice, and ALCAR treatment restored learning and memory.

However there is no prophylactic nutrition that can prevent the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring after MIA. The aim of this study was undertaken to examine whether dietary intake of glucoraphanin (GF: the precursor of a natural anti-inflammatory compound sulforaphane) can prevent the onset of behavioral abnormalities in offspring after MIA. METHODS: One percent of GF food pellet or normal food pellet was given into female mice during pregnancy and lactation (from E5 to P21). Saline (5 mL/kg/d) or poly(I:C) (5 mg/kg/d) was injected into pregnant mice from E12 to E17. Behavioral tests and immunohistochemistry of parvalbumin (PV) were performed in male offspring. RESULTS: Dietary intake of GF during pregnancy and lactation prevented cognitive deficits and social interaction deficits in the juvenile offspring after MIA. Furthermore dietary intake of GF during pregnancy and lactation prevented cognitive deficits in the adult offspring after MIA. Moreover dietary intake of GF prevented the reduction of PV immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex of adult offspring after MIA.

M.Fischer U.Chen W.","PLoS Genet",NA,"Malfunction of pre-mRNA processing factors are linked to several human diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration. Here we report the identification of a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the SNRPE gene (c.65T>C (p.Phe22Ser)) in a patient with non-syndromal primary (congenital) microcephaly and intellectual disability. SNRPE encodes SmE a basal component of pre-mRNA processing U snRNPs. We show that the microcephaly-linked SmE variant is unable to interact with the SMN complex and as a consequence fails to assemble into U snRNPs. This results in widespread mRNA splicing alterations in fibroblast cells derived from this patient. Similar alterations were observed in HEK293 cells upon SmE depletion that could be rescued by the expression of wild type but not mutant SmE. Importantly the depletion of SmE in zebrafish causes aberrant mRNA splicing alterations and reduced brain size reminiscent of the patient microcephaly phenotype. We identify the EMX2 mRNA which encodes a protein required for proper brain development as a major mis-spliced down stream target. Together our study links defects in the SNRPE gene to microcephaly and suggests that alterations of cellular splicing of specific mRNAs such as EMX2 results in the neurological phenotype of the disease.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074681757&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1008460&partnerID=40&md5=cffbb61627a99624f57d793a3b8697fe","Laboratory for Functional Genomics and Systems Biology Berlin Institute for Medical System Biology Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine Berlin Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) Shenzhen China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCancer Science Institute of Singapore National University of Singapore Singapore.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biochemistry Theodor-Boveri-Institute University of Würzburg Würzburg Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAcademy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) Shenzhen China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCharité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin Institute of Cell Biology and Neurobiology Berlin Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCharité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin Department of Pediatric Neurology Berlin Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCharité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin Center for Chronically Sick Children Berlin Germany.",2019,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1008460","Article","*Alternative SplicingAnimalsCell LineDisease Models AnimalFemaleHEK293 CellsHomeodomain Proteins/*geneticsHumansIntellectual Disability/*geneticsMicrocephaly/*genetics*Mutation MissensePedigreeRNA SplicingRNA Messenger/geneticsRibonucleoproteins Small Nuclear/metabolismTranscription Factors/*geneticsWhole Exome SequencingZebrafishsnRNP Core Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism","pubmed-31671093.pdf","pubmed-31671093","xml_texts/PMC6850558.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008460.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008460.pdf"

A micro-deletion of the 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 chromosomic region has been identified in 1% of patients also displaying intellectual disabilities. In mouse models generated to understand the mechanisms of this deletion, learning and memory deficits were pervasive in most genetic backgrounds, while social communication deficits were only detected in some models. To complement previous studies, we itemized the social deficits in the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion on a hybrid C57BL/6N × C3H. Pde6b +  genetic background. We examined whether behavioural deficits were visible over long-term observation periods lasting several days and nights, to parallel everyday-life assessment of patients. We recorded the individual and social behaviours of mice carrying a heterozygous deletion of the homologous 16p11.2 chromosomic region (hereafter Del/+) and their wild-type littermates from both sexes over two or three consecutive nights during social interactions of familiar mixed-genotype quartets of males and of females, and of same-genotype unfamiliar female pairs. We observed that Del/+ mice of both sexes increased significantly their locomotor activity compared to wild-type littermates. In the social domain, Del/+ mice of both sexes displayed widespread deficits, even more so in males than in females in quartets of familiar individuals. In pairs, significant perturbations of the organisation of the social communication and behaviours appeared in Del/+ females. Altogether, this suggests that, over long recording periods, the phenotype of the 16p11.2 Del/+ mice was differently affected in the locomotor activity and the social domains and between the two sexes. These findings confirm the importance of testing models in long-term conditions to provide a comprehensive view of their phenotype that will refine the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms and complement pre-clinical targeted therapeutic trials.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38173978","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)",2024,"10.3389/fnbeh.2023.1294558","Article","16p11.2 deletion; autism; long-term monitoring; mouse model; social behaviour; spontaneous behaviour; ultrasonic vocalisations","pubmed-38173978.pdf","pubmed-38173978","xml_texts/PMC10763239.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2023.1294558.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2023.1294558.pdf"
"SHANK3 in vagal sensory neurons regulates body temperature, systemic inflammation, and sepsis.","Zhang, L; Bang, S; He, Q; Matsuda, M; Luo, X; Jiang, YH; Ji, RR","Front Immunol",NA,"Excessive inflammation has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully studied. SHANK3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein and mutations of  SHANK3  are involved in ASD. Shank3 expression in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons also regulates heat pain and touch. However, the role of Shank3 in the vagus system remains unknown. We induced systemic inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and measured body temperature and serum IL-6 levels in mice. We found that homozygous and heterozygous  Shank3  deficiency, but not  Shank2  and  Trpv1  deficiency, aggravates hypothermia, systemic inflammation (serum IL-6 levels), and sepsis mortality in mice, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, these deficits can be recapitulated by specific deletion of  Shank3  in Nav1.8-expressing sensory neurons in conditional knockout (CKO) mice or by selective knockdown of  Shank3  or  Trpm2  in vagal sensory neurons in nodose ganglion (NG). Mice with  Shank3  deficiency have normal basal core temperature but fail to adjust body temperature after perturbations with lower or higher body temperatures or auricular vagus nerve stimulation.  In situ  hybridization with RNAscope revealed that  Shank3  is broadly expressed by vagal sensory neurons and this expression was largely lost in  Shank3  cKO mice. Mechanistically,  Shank3  regulates the expression of  Trpm2  in NG, as  Trpm2  but not  Trpv1  mRNA levels in NG were significantly reduced in  Shank3  KO mice.

"Genetic background mutations drive neural circuit hyperconnectivity in a fragile X syndrome model","Kennedy T.Rinker D.Broadie K.","BMC Biol",NA,"BACKGROUND: Neural circuits are initially assembled during development when neurons synapse with potential partners and later refined as appropriate connections stabilize into mature synapses while inappropriate contacts are eliminated. Disruptions to this synaptogenic process impair connectivity optimization and can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often characterized by synaptic overgrowth with the maintenance of immature or inappropriate synapses. Such synaptogenic defects can occur through mutation of a single gene such as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causing the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS represents the leading heritable cause of ID and ASD but many other genes that play roles in ID and ASD have yet to be identified. RESULTS: In a Drosophila FXS disease model one dfmr1(50M) null mutant stock exhibits previously unreported axonal overgrowths at developmental and mature stages in the giant fiber (GF) escape circuit. These excess axon projections contain both chemical and electrical synapse markers indicating mixed synaptic connections. Extensive analyses show these supernumerary synapses connect known GF circuit neurons rather than new inappropriate partners indicating hyperconnectivity within the circuit. Despite the striking similarities to well-characterized FXS synaptic defects this new GF circuit hyperconnectivity phenotype is driven by genetic background mutations in this dfmr1(50M) stock. Similar GF circuit synaptic overgrowth is not observed in independent dfmr1 null alleles. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to neural circuit hyperconnectivity. The results reveal 8 QTL associated with inappropriate synapse formation and maintenance in the dfmr1(50M) mutant background. CONCLUSIONS: Synaptogenesis is a complex precisely orchestrated neurodevelopmental process with a large cohort of gene products coordinating the connectivity synaptic strength and excitatory/inhibitory balance between neuronal partners.

These QTL regions contain potential new genes involved in synapse formation and refinement.

"Targeted Metabolomic Analysis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB Mouse Model Reveals an Imbalance of Branched-Chain Amino Acid and Fatty Acid Metabolism","De Pasquale V., Caterino M., Costanzo M., Fedele R., Ruoppolo M., Pavone L. M.","Int J Mol Sci",NA,"Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are inherited disorders of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism. The defective digestion of GAGs within the intralysosomal compartment of affected patients leads to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from cardiovascular disease to neurological impairment. The molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease downstream of the genetic mutation of genes encoding for lysosomal enzymes still remain unclear. Here we applied a targeted metabolomic approach to a mouse model of PS IIIB using a platform dedicated to the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders in order to identify amino acid and fatty acid metabolic pathway alterations or the manifestations of other metabolic phenotypes. Our analysis highlighted an increase in the levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: Val Ile and Leu) aromatic amino acids (Tyr and Phe) free carnitine and acylcarnitines in the liver and heart tissues of MPS IIIB mice as compared to the wild type (WT). Moreover Ala Met Glu Gly Arg Orn and Cit amino acids were also found upregulated in the liver of MPS IIIB mice. These findings show a specific impairment of the BCAA and fatty acid catabolism in the heart of MPS IIIB mice. In the liver of affected mice the glucose-alanine cycle and urea cycle resulted in being altered alongside a deregulation of the BCAA metabolism. Thus our data demonstrate that an accumulation of BCAAs occurs secondary to lysosomal GAG storage in both the liver and the heart of MPS IIIB mice. Since BCAAs regulate the biogenesis of lysosomes and autophagy mechanisms through mTOR signaling impacting on lipid metabolism this condition might contribute to the progression of the MPS IIIB disease.",NA,NA,2020,"10.3390/ijms21124211","Article",NA,"pubmed-32545699.pdf","pubmed-32545699","xml_texts/PMC7352355.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms21124211.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms21124211.pdf"

However developmental disorders linked to Reelin deficits such as schizophrenia and autism are related to GABAergic interneuron-derived Reelin although its role in migration has not been established. Here we selectively inactivated the Reln gene in CR cells or GABAergic interneurons. We show that CR cells have a major role in the inside-out order of migration while CR and GABAergic cells sequentially cooperate to prevent invasion of cortical neurons into layer I. Furthermore GABAergic cell-derived Reelin compensates some features of the reeler phenotype and is needed for the fine tuning of the layer-specific distribution of cortical neurons. In the hippocampus the inactivation of Reelin in CR cells causes dramatic alterations in the dentate gyrus and mild defects in the hippocampus proper. These findings lead to a model in which both CR and GABAergic cell-derived Reelin cooperate to build the inside-out order of corticogenesis which might provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders linked to abnormal migration and Reelin deficits.",NA,"Department of Cell Biology Physiology and Immunology Faculty of Biology Institute of Neurosciences Universitat de Barcelona 08028 Barcelona Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas Instituto de Salud Carlos III Madrid 28031 Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstituto de Neurociencias Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas and Universidad Miguel Hernández 03550 Sant Joan d'Alacant Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Experimental Psychology Universidad de Sevilla 41018 Sevilla Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAndalusian Center for Molecular Biology and Regenerative Medicine Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas Seville 41092 Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Yale University School of Medicine New Haven CT 06508 United States of America.",2022,"10.1073/pnas.2120079119","Article","AnimalsCell Movement*Cerebral Cortex/cytology/embryologyGABAergic Neurons/enzymologyHippocampus/embryology/enzymologyInterneurons/enzymologyMice*Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism*Neurons/cytology/enzymology*Reelin Protein/genetics/metabolismCajal–Retzius cellsGABAergic interneuronscorticogenesisneurodevelopmental disorders","pubmed-36067316.pdf","pubmed-36067316","xml_texts/PMC9477240.xml","full_texts/10.1073%2Fpnas.2120079119.txt","full_texts/10.1073%2Fpnas.2120079119.pdf"

We hypothesize that soy protein-based diets increase weight gain and alter neurobehavioral outcomes. Our objective herein was to test matched casein- and soy protein-based purified ingredient diets in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome,  Fmr1 KO  mice. The experimental methods included assessment of growth; 24-7 activity levels; motor coordination; learning and memory; blood-based amino acid, phytoestrogen and glucose levels; and organ weights. The primary outcome measure was body weight. We find increased body weight in male  Fmr1 KO  from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P224, male wild type (WT) from P32-P39, female  Fmr1 KO  from P6-P18 and P168-P224, and female  Fmr1 HET  from P9-P18 as a function of soy. Activity at the beginning of the light and dark cycles increased in female  Fmr1 HET  and  Fmr1 KO  mice fed soy. We did not find significant differences in rotarod or passive avoidance behavior as a function of genotype or diet. Several blood-based amino acids and phytoestrogens were significantly altered in response to soy. Liver weight was increased in WT and adipose tissue in  Fmr1 KO  mice fed soy. Activity levels at the beginning of the light cycle and testes weight were greater in  Fmr1 KO  versus WT males irrespective of diet. DEXA analysis at 8-months-old indicated increased fat mass and total body area in  Fmr1 KO  females and lean mass and bone mineral density in  Fmr1 KO  males fed soy. Overall, dietary consumption of soy protein isolate by C57BL/6J mice caused increased growth, which could be attributed to increased lean mass in males and fat mass in females.

Here we studied the biochemical effect of mutant p35 on its known properties i.e. stability CDK5 activation and cellular localization using heterologous expression in cultured cells. We also examined the effect of the mutations on axon elongation in cultured primary neurons and migration of newborn neurons in embryonic brains.

"Mouse models of MeCP2 disorders share gene expression changes in the cerebellum and hypothalamus","Ben-Shachar S.Chahrour M.Thaller C.Shaw C. A.Zoghbi H. Y.","Hum Mol Genet",NA,"A group of post-natal neurodevelopmental disorders collectively referred to as MeCP2 disorders are caused by aberrations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Loss of MeCP2 function causes Rett syndrome (RTT) whereas increased copy number of the gene causes MECP2 duplication or triplication syndromes. MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor however the gene expression changes observed in the hypothalamus of MeCP2 disorder mouse models suggest that MeCP2 can also upregulate gene expression given that the majority of genes are downregulated upon loss of MeCP2 and upregulated in its presence. To determine if this dual role of MeCP2 extends beyond the hypothalamus we studied gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of Mecp2-null and MECP2-Tg mice modeling RTT and MECP2 duplication syndrome respectively. We found that abnormal MeCP2 dosage causes alterations in the expression of hundreds of genes in the cerebellum. The majority of genes were upregulated in MECP2-Tg mice and downregulated in Mecp2-null mice consistent with a role for MeCP2 as a modulator that can both increase and decrease gene expression. Interestingly many of the genes altered in the cerebellum particularly those increased by the presence of MeCP2 and decreased in its absence were similarly altered in the hypothalamus. Our data suggest that either gain or loss of MeCP2 results in gene expression changes in multiple brain regions and that some of these changes are global. Further delineation of the expression pattern of MeCP2 target genes throughout the brain might identify subsets of genes that are more amenable to manipulation and can thus be used to modulate some of the disease phenotypes.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67249150482&doi=10.1093%2fhmg%2fddp181&partnerID=40&md5=24f8cc767b1cd62d798beb9c8ae7e42a","Department of Molecular and Human Genetics Baylor College of Medicine Houston TX 77030 USA.",2009,"10.1093/hmg/ddp181","Article","AnimalsCerebellum/*metabolismDisease Models AnimalGene Dosage*Gene Expression RegulationHumansHypothalamus/*metabolismMethyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/*genetics/*metabolismMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutMice TransgenicRett Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism","pubmed-19369296.pdf","pubmed-19369296","xml_texts/PMC2694691.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fhmg%2Fddp181.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fhmg%2Fddp181.pdf"

The adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) modulators of neuronal damage could play a role in FXS. A synaptic colocalization and a strong permissive interaction between A(2A) and mGlu5 receptors in the hippocampus have been previously reported suggesting that blocking A(2A)Rs might normalize the mGlu5R-mediated effects of FXS. To study the cross-talk between A(2A) and mGlu5 receptors in the absence of FMRP we performed extracellular electrophysiology experiments in hippocampal slices of Fmr1 KO mouse. The depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) slope induced by the mGlu5R agonist CHPG was completely blocked by the A(2A)R antagonist ZM241385 and strongly potentiated by the A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 suggesting that the functional synergistic coupling between the two receptors could be increased in FXS. To verify if chronic A(2A)R blockade could reverse the FXS phenotypes we treated the Fmr1 KO mice with istradefylline an A(2A)R antagonist. We found that hippocampal DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) which is abnormally increased in FXS mice was restored to the WT level. Furthermore istradefylline corrected aberrant dendritic spine density specific behavioral alterations and overactive mTOR TrkB and STEP signaling in Fmr1 KO mice. Finally we identified A(2A)R mRNA as a target of FMRP.

Mutations in COQ8A in humans result in CoQ10 deficiency the clinical features of which include early-onset cerebellar ataxia seizures and intellectual disability. The rapid advancement of massively parallel sequencing has resulted in the identification of more than 40 new mutations in COQ8A and functional studies are required to confirm causality and to further research into determining the specific mechanisms through which the mutations result in loss of function. To that end a Drosophila model of Coq8 deficiency was developed and characterized to determine its appropriateness as a model system to further explore the role of Coq8 in the brain and for functional characterisation of Coq8 mutations. Pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of Coq8 was largely lethal with female escapers displaying severe locomotor deficits. Knockdown of Coq8 in the eye resulted in degeneration of photoreceptors progressive necrosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Reintroduction of wild-type Coq8 restored normal function however expression of human wild-type COQ8A exacerbated the eye phenotype suggesting it was acting as a dominant-negative.

We find that Shank3 disruption led to a reduction of neurons encoding the experience of other mice and an increase in neurons encoding the animal's own experience. This shift was associated with a loss of ability by neurons to distinguish other from self and therefore the inability to encode social agency. Restoration of Shank3 expression in the mPFC reversed this encoding imbalance and increased sociability over 5-8 weeks.

"Assessing the requirements of prenatal UBE3A expression for rescue of behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model for Angelman syndrome","Sonzogni M.Zhai P.Mientjes E. J.van Woerden G. M.Elgersma Y.","Mol Autism",NA,"BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of functional ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). In neurons UBE3A expression is tightly regulated by a mechanism of imprinting which suppresses the expression of the paternal UBE3A allele. Promising treatment strategies for AS are directed at activating paternal UBE3A gene expression. However for such strategies to be successful it is important to know when such a treatment should start and how much UBE3A expression is needed for normal embryonic brain development. METHODS: Using a conditional mouse model of AS we further delineated the critical period for UBE3A expression during early brain development. Ube3a gene expression was induced around the second week of gestation and mouse phenotypes were assessed using a behavioral test battery. To investigate the requirements of embryonic UBE3A expression we made use of mice in which the paternal Ube3a allele was deleted. RESULTS: We observed a full behavioral rescue of the AS mouse model phenotypes when Ube3a gene reactivation was induced around the start of the last week of mouse embryonic development. We found that full silencing of the paternal Ube3a allele was not completed till the first week after birth but that deletion of the paternal Ube3a allele had no significant effect on the assessed phenotypes. LIMITATIONS: Direct translation to human is limited as we do not precisely know how human and mouse brain development aligns over gestational time. Moreover many of the assessed phenotypes have limited translational value as the underlying brain regions involved in these tasks are largely unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further important insights in the requirement of UBE3A expression during brain development. We found that loss of up to 50% of UBE3A protein during prenatal mouse brain development does not significantly impact the assessed mouse behavioral phenotypes. Together with previous findings our results indicate that the most critical function for mouse UBE3A lies in the early postnatal period between birth and P21.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091324679&doi=10.1186%2fs13229-020-00376-9&partnerID=40&md5=41aa4ff279f11f2a4a1247b22caf615e","Department of Neuroscience and the ENCORE Expertise Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Erasmus MC University Medical Center 3015 CN Rotterdam The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University No.357 Ximendajie Street Kaifeng City Henan Province China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience and the ENCORE Expertise Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Erasmus MC University Medical Center 3015 CN Rotterdam The Netherlands. y.elgersma@erasmusmc.nl.",2020,"10.1186/s13229-020-00376-9","Article","AllelesAngelman Syndrome/*geneticsAnimals*Behavior AnimalBrain/embryology/pathologyDisease Models AnimalEmbryonic Development/genetics*Gene Expression Regulation DevelopmentalGene SilencingIntegrases/metabolismMice Inbred C57BLNestin/metabolism*PhenotypeUbiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolismASO therapyAngelman syndromeBehaviorCritical periodMouse modelUbe3a","pubmed-32948244.pdf","pubmed-32948244","xml_texts/PMC7501605.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-020-00376-9.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-020-00376-9.pdf"
"Assessing the Cntnap2 knockout rat prepulse inhibition deficit through prepulse scaling of the baseline startle response curve.","El-Cheikh Mohamad, A; Möhrle, D; Haddad, FL; Rose, A; Allman, BL; Schmid, S","Transl Psychiatry",NA,"Many neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are associated with changes in sensory processing and sensorimotor gating. The acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle are widely used translational measures for assessing sensory processing and sensorimotor gating, respectively. The Cntnap2 knockout (KO) rat has proven to be a valid model for ASD, displaying core symptoms, including sensory processing perturbations. Here, we used a novel method to assess startle and PPI in Cntnap2 KO rats that allows for the identification of separate scaling components: startle scaling, which is a change in startle amplitude to a given sound, and sound scaling, which reflects a change in sound processing. Cntnap2 KO rats show increased startle due to both an increased overall response (startle scaling) and a left shift of the sound/response curve (sound scaling). In the presence of a prepulse, wildtype rats show a reduction of startle due to both startle scaling and sound scaling, whereas Cntnap2 KO rats show normal startle scaling, but disrupted sound scaling, resulting in the reported PPI deficit. These results validate that startle and sound scaling by a prepulse are indeed two independent processes, with only the latter being impaired in Cntnap2 KO rats. As startle scaling is likely related to motor output and sound scaling to sound processing, this novel approach reveals additional information on the possible cause of PPI disruptions in preclinical models.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37852987","Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry|Western University",2023,"10.1038/s41398-023-02629-6","Article",NA,"pubmed-37852987.pdf","pubmed-37852987","xml_texts/PMC10584930.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41398-023-02629-6.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41398-023-02629-6.pdf"
"Unraveling the nature of autism: finding order amid change","Hellendoorn A.Wijnroks L.Leseman P. P.","Front Psychol",NA,"In this article we hypothesize that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are born with a deficit in invariance detection which is a learning process whereby people and animals come to attend the relatively stable patterns or structural regularities in the changing stimulus array. This paper synthesizes a substantial body of research which suggests that a deficit in the domain-general perceptual learning process of invariant detection in ASD can lead to a cascade of consequences in different developmental domains. We will outline how this deficit in invariant detection can cause uncertainty unpredictability and a lack of control for individuals with ASD and how varying degrees of impairments in this learning process can account for the heterogeneity of the ASD phenotype. We also describe how differences in neural plasticity in ASD underlie the impairments in perceptual learning.

In mammals changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases(2). Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity stress and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders(3). However the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice with implications for our understanding of how diet infection and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074087424&doi=10.1038%2fs41586-019-1644-y&partnerID=40&md5=a20f2bbe45cc5317143be3ea00d702ca","Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rFeil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rBoyce Thompson Institute and Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Cornell University Ithaca NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKlarman Cell Observatory Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Cambridge MA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Biomedical Science and Bioelectronic Medicine Feinstein Institute for Medical Research Northwell Health Manhasset NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rElmezzi Graduate School Feinstein Institute for Medical Research Northwell Health Manhasset NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Surgery Northshore University Hospital Northwell Health Manhasset NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDonald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell Hempstead NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rHoward Hughes Medical Institute Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Research Department of Biology Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge MA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rFeil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA. col2004@med.cornell.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA. col2004@med.cornell.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA. col2004@med.cornell.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rJill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Weill Cornell Medicine Cornell University New York NY USA. dartis@med.cornell.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rFriedman Center for Nutrition and Inflammation Joan and Sanford I.

"Developmental nicotine exposure engenders intergenerational downregulation and aberrant posttranslational modification of cardinal epigenetic factors in the frontal cortices striata and hippocampi of adolescent mice","Buck J. M.O'Neill H. C.Stitzel J. A.","Epigenetics Chromatin",NA,"BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking of traditional or electronic cigarettes during pregnancy which constitutes developmental nicotine exposure (DNE) heightens the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD autism and schizophrenia in children. Modeling the intergenerationally transmissible impacts of smoking during pregnancy we previously demonstrated that both the first- and second-generation adolescent offspring of nicotine-exposed female mice exhibit enhanced nicotine preference hyperactivity and risk-taking behaviors aberrant rhythmicity of home cage activity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and dopamine transporter dysfunction impaired furin-mediated proBDNF proteolysis hypocorticosteronemia-related glucocorticoid receptor hypoactivity and global DNA hypomethylation in the frontal cortices and striata. This ensemble of multigenerational DNE-induced behavioral neuropharmacological neurotrophic neuroendocrine and DNA methylomic anomalies recapitulates the pathosymptomatology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD autism and schizophrenia. Further probing the epigenetic bases of DNE-induced multigenerational phenotypic aberrations the present study examined the expression and phosphorylation of key epigenetic factors via an array of immunoblot experiments. RESULTS: Data indicate that DNE confers intergenerational deficits in corticostriatal DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression accompanied by downregulation of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in the frontal cortices and hippocampi while the expression of ten-eleven translocase methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) is unaltered. Moreover DNE evokes multigenerational abnormalities in HDAC2 (Ser(394)) but not MeCP2 (Ser(421)) phosphorylation in the frontal cortices striata and hippocampi. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the extensive gene regulatory roles of DNMT3A MeCP2 and HDAC2 the findings of this study that DNE elicits downregulation and aberrant posttranslational modification of these factors in both first- and second-generation DNE mice suggest that epigenetic perturbations may constitute a mechanistic hub for the intergenerational transmission of DNE-induced neurodevelopmental disorder-like phenotypes.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081234710&doi=10.1186%2fs13072-020-00332-0&partnerID=40&md5=dc74b7083d7b581e5cccae3359809477","Institute for Behavioral Genetics University of Colorado 1480 30th Street Boulder CO 80309-0447 USA.

"Persistent astrocyte activation in the fragile X mouse cerebellum","Pacey L. K.Guan S.Tharmalingam S.Thomsen C.Hampson D. R.","Brain Behav",NA,"BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome the most common single gene cause of autism results from loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Although FMRP is highly expressed in neurons it has also recently been identified in glia. It has been postulated that in the absence of FMRP abnormal function of non-neuronal cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. We previously demonstrated reduced numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and delayed myelination in the cerebellum of fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice. METHODS: We used quantitative western blotting and immunocytochemistry to examine the status of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebellum of Fmr1 mice during development and in adulthood. RESULTS: We report increased expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP in the cerebellum of Fmr1 mice starting in the second postnatal week and persisting in to adulthood. At 2 weeks postnatal expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) were elevated in the Fmr1 KO cerebellum. In adults expression of TNFR2 and the glial marker S100β were also elevated in Fmr1 knockouts but LIF expression was not different from wild-type mice. We found no evidence of microglial activation or neuroinflammation at any age examined. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an atypical pattern of astrogliosis in the absence of microglial activation in Fmr1 knockout mouse cerebellum. Enhanced TNFR2 and LIF expression in young mice suggests that changes in the expression of astrocytic proteins may be an attempt to compensate for delayed myelination in the developing cerebellum of Fmr1 mice.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945242993&doi=10.1002%2fbrb3.400&partnerID=40&md5=764ffdaa40c591e23dcbe1e787c2c606","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroinflammation Lundbeck Research USA 215 College Road Paramus New Jersey 07652.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmaceutical Sciences Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2 ; Department of Pharmacology Faculty of Medicine University of Toronto 144 College Street Toronto Ontario Canada M5S 3M2.",2015,"10.1002/brb3.400","Article","AnimalsAstrocytes/metabolism/*pathologyAutistic Disorder/genetics/metabolism/pathologyCerebellum/metabolism/pathologyDisease Models AnimalFemaleFragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/metabolismFragile X Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/*pathologyMiceMice KnockoutMicroglia/metabolism/*pathologyNeuroglia/metabolism/*pathologyNeurons/metabolism/*pathologyAstrogliosisFmrpGfapLifS100bTnfr2autismmyelinoligodendrocyte precursor cells","pubmed-26516618.pdf","pubmed-26516618","xml_texts/PMC4614053.xml","full_texts/10.1002%2Fbrb3.400.txt","full_texts/10.1002%2Fbrb3.400.pdf"

The amounts of mitochondrial transcription factor NRF-1 ATP synthases ATP5A and ATPB and the mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC1 in EVs were reduced in cerebral cortex samples and astrocytes from Fmr1 KO mice.

Our data reveal that targeted binding of MeCP2 elicits extensive chromatin unfolding. MeCP2-induced chromatin unfolding is triggered independently of the methyl-cytosine-binding domain.

The mechanism responsible for this unusual mutation is not fully understood. We have previously shown that mismatch repair (MMR) complexes MSH2/MSH3 (MutSβ) and MSH2/MSH6 (MutSα) together with Polβ a DNA polymerase important for base excision repair (BER) are important for expansions in a mouse model of these disorders. Here we show that MLH1/MLH3 (MutLγ) a protein complex that can act downstream of MutSβ in MMR is also required for all germ line and somatic expansions. However exonuclease I (EXO1) which acts downstream of MutL proteins in MMR is not required. In fact a null mutation in Exo1 results in more extensive germ line and somatic expansions than is seen in Exo1+/+ animals. Furthermore mice homozygous for a point mutation (D173A) in Exo1 that eliminates its nuclease activity but retains its native conformation shows a level of expansion that is intermediate between Exo1+/+ and Exo1-/- animals. Thus our data suggests that expansion of the FX repeat in this mouse model occurs via a MutLγ-dependent EXO1-independent pathway with EXO1 protecting against expansion both in a nuclease-dependent and a nuclease-independent manner.

"Enhancing VTA Ca v 1.3 L-type Ca2+ channel activity promotes cocaine and mood-related behaviors via overlapping AMPA receptor mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens","Martínez-Rivera A.; Hao J.; Tropea T.F.; Giordano T.P.; Kosovsky M.; Rice R.C.; Lee A.; Huganir R.L.; Striessnig J.; Addy N.A.; Han S.; Rajadhyaksha A.M.","Molecular Psychiatry",NA,"Genetic factors significantly influence susceptibility for substance abuse and mood disorders. Rodent studies have begun to elucidate a role of Ca v 1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels in neuropsychiatric-related behaviors, such as addictive and depressive-like behaviors. Human studies have also linked the CACNA1D gene, which codes for the Ca v 1.3 protein, with bipolar disorder. However, the neurocircuitry and the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Ca v 1.3 in neuropsychiatric phenotypes are not well established. In the present study, we directly manipulated Ca v 1.3 channels in Ca v 1.2 dihydropyridine insensitive mutant mice and found that ventral tegmental area (VTA) Ca v 1.3 channels mediate cocaine-related and depressive-like behavior through a common nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell calcium-permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (CP-AMPAR) mechanism that requires GluA1 phosphorylation at S831. Selective activation of VTA Ca v 1.3 with (±)-BayK-8644 (BayK) enhanced cocaine conditioned place preference and cocaine psychomotor activity while inducing depressive-like behavior, an effect not observed in S831A phospho-mutant mice. Infusion of the CP-AMPAR-specific blocker Naspm into the NAc shell reversed the cocaine and depressive-like phenotypes. In addition, activation of VTA Ca v 1.3 channels resulted in social behavioral deficits. In contrast to the cocaine- and depression-related phenotypes, GluA1/A2 AMPARs in the NAc core mediated social deficits, independent of S831-GluA1 phosphorylation. Using a candidate gene analysis approach, we also identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CACNA1D gene associated with cocaine dependence in human subjects.

As is the case for most pesticides potential adverse effects of GLA have not been studied from the perspective of developmental neurotoxicity. Early pesticides exposure may weaken the basic structure of the developing brain and cause permanent changes leading to a wide range of lifelong effects on health and/or behavior. Here we addressed the developmental impact of GLA by exposing female mice to low dose GLA during both pre- and postnatal periods and analyzed potential developmental and behavioral changes of the offspring during infancy and adulthood. A neurobehavioral test battery revealed significant effects of GLA maternal exposure on early reflex development pup communication affiliative behaviors and preference for social olfactory cues but emotional reactivity and emotional memory remained unaltered. These behavioral alterations showed a striking resemblance to changes seen in animal models of Autistic Spectrum Disorders. At the brain level GLA maternal exposure caused some increase in relative brain weight of the offspring. In addition reduced expression of Pten and Peg3 - two genes implicated in autism-like deficits - was observed in the brain of GLA-exposed pups at postnatal day 15. Our work thus provides new data on the link between pre- and postnatal exposure to the herbicide GLA and the onset of autism-like symptoms later in life. It also raises fundamental concerns about the ability of current safety testing to assess risks of pesticide exposure during critical developmental periods.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979939239&doi=10.3389%2ffnbeh.2014.00390&partnerID=40&md5=a2e3183fc2f9ff00318d29653d056f26","Immunologie et Neurogénétique Expérimentales et Moléculaires - UMR7355 CNRS - 3b  Orléans  France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rImmunologie et Neurogénétique Expérimentales et Moléculaires - UMR7355 CNRS - 3b  Orléans  France ; Département de génétique Centre Hospitalier Régional  Orléans  France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversité d'Orléans  Orléans  France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rImmunologie et Neurogénétique Expérimentales et Moléculaires - UMR7355 CNRS - 3b  Orléans  France ; Université d'Orléans  Orléans  France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rIRSET INSERM U 1085 Université de Rennes I  Rennes  France.",2014,"10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00390","Article","autistic spectrum disordersglufosinate ammoniummiceneurodevelopmentpre- and postnatal exposure","pubmed-25477793.pdf","pubmed-25477793","xml_texts/PMC4238406.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00390.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00390.pdf"

S.Cook E. H.Geschwind D. H.Dobyns W. B.Scherer S. W.Christian S. L.","Plos one",NA,"BACKGROUND: Autism is a complex childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Microdeletion or duplication of a approximately 500-700-kb genomic rearrangement on 16p11.2 that contains 24 genes represents the second most frequent chromosomal disorder associated with autism. The role of common and rare 16p11.2 sequence variants in autism etiology is unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify common 16p11.2 variants with a potential role in autism we performed association studies using existing data generated from three microarray platforms: Affymetrix 5.0 (777 families) Illumina 550 K (943 families) and Affymetrix 500 K (60 families). No common variants were identified that were significantly associated with autism. To look for rare variants we performed resequencing of coding and promoter regions for eight candidate genes selected based on their known expression patterns and functions. In total we identified 26 novel variants in autism: 13 exonic (nine non-synonymous three synonymous and one untranslated region) and 13 promoter variants. We found a significant association between autism and a coding variant in the seizure-related gene SEZ6L2 (12/1106 autism vs. 3/1161 controls; p = 0.018). Sez6l2 expression in mouse embryos was restricted to the spinal cord and brain. SEZ6L2 expression in human fetal brain was highest in post-mitotic cortical layers hippocampus amygdala and thalamus. Association analysis of SEZ6L2 in an independent sample set failed to replicate our initial findings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified sequence variation in at least one candidate gene in 16p11.2 that may represent a novel genetic risk factor for autism. However further studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864276520&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0004582&partnerID=40&md5=1bdbd390f658ec48e8763876272282d4","Department of Human Genetics The University of Chicago Chicago Illinois USA.",2009,"10.1371/journal.pone.0004582","Article","AnimalsAutistic Disorder/etiology/*geneticsChromosomes Human Pair 16/*geneticsDNA Mutational AnalysisEmbryo MammalianExons/geneticsFamily HealthGenetic Predisposition to Disease*Genetic VariationHumansMembrane Proteins/*geneticsMicePromoter Regions Genetic/genetics","pubmed-19242545.pdf","pubmed-19242545","xml_texts/PMC2644762.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004582.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004582.pdf"

K.Tranfaglia M.","Sci Rep",NA,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) an X-chromosome linked intellectual disability is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a neurodevelopmental condition that currently has no specific drug treatment. Building upon the demonstrated therapeutic effects on spatial memory of bryostatin-1 a relatively specific activator of protein kinase C (PKC)ε (also of PKCα) on impaired synaptic plasticity/maturation and spatial learning and memory in FXS mice we investigated whether bryostatin-1 might affect the autistic phenotypes and other behaviors including open field activity activities of daily living (nesting and marble burying) at the effective therapeutic dose for spatial memory deficits. Further evaluation included other non-spatial learning and memory tasks. Interestingly a short period of treatment (5 weeks) only produced very limited or no therapeutic effects on the autistic and cognitive phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO2 mice while a longer treatment (13 weeks) with the same dose of bryostatin-1 effectively rescued the autistic and non-spatial learning deficit cognitive phenotypes. It is possible that longer-term treatment would result in further improvement in these fragile X phenotypes. This effect is clearly different from other treatment strategies tested to date in that the drug shows little acute effect but strong long-term effects. It also shows no evidence of tolerance which has been a problem with other drug classes (mGluR5 antagonists GABA-A and -B agonists). The results strongly suggest that at appropriate dosing and therapeutic period chronic bryostatin-1 may have great therapeutic value for both ASD and FXS.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093839936&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-74848-6&partnerID=40&md5=596ea78852848b1dda2f88a748309e4a","FRAXA-DVI FRAXA Santiago Chile. patricia.cogram@gmail.com.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rIEB Faculty of Science University of Chile Santiago Chile. patricia.cogram@gmail.com.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeurotrope Bioscience Inc.

Nonetheless, genetic association does not indicate a functional link of a given gene to neuronal activity and associated behaviors. In addition, interaction between multiple genes is often needed to sculpt complex traits such as behavior. Thus, modulation of neuronal functions by a given gene product, such as Fxr1, has to be thoroughly studied in the context of its interactions with other gene products. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) is a shared target of several psychoactive drugs. In addition, interaction between functional polymorphisms of GSK3b and FXR1 has been implicated in mood regulation in healthy subjects and bipolar patients. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of this interaction remain unknown. We used somatic CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout and overexpression to investigate the impact of Fxr1 and its regulator Gsk3 beta on neuronal functions directly in the adult mouse brain. Suppression of Gsk3 beta or increase of Fxr1 expression in medial prefrontal cortex neurons leads to anxiolytic-like responses associated with a decrease in AMPA mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Furthermore, Fxr1 and Gsk3 beta modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission via regulation of AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 as well as vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut1. These results underscore a potential mechanism underlying the action of Fxr1 on neuronal activity and behaviors. Association between the Gsk3 beta-Fxr1 pathway and glutamatergic signaling also suggests how it may contribute to emotional regulation in response to mood stabilizers, or in illnesses like mood disorders and schizophrenia.",NA,NA,2018,"10.3389/fnmol.2018.00119","Article",NA,"wos-000429831200001.pdf","wos-000429831200001","xml_texts/PMC5906571.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00119.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00119.pdf"

Simultaneously the mice showed spatial learning and memory deficits with a prominently elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in the brain. Importantly selective facilitating tau degradation by using a novel designed proteolysis-targeting chimera named C4 could effectively ameliorate the epileptic seizures with remarkable restoration of neuronal firing activities and improvement of spatial learning and memory functions.

The disruption in the function of the FMR1 gene results in a range of alterations in cellular and synaptic function. Previous studies have identified dynamic alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission in early postnatal development in the amygdala of the mouse model of FXS. However little is known about how these changes alter microcircuit development and plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA). Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology we demonstrate that principal neurons (PNs) in the LA exhibit hyperexcitability with a concomitant increase in the synaptic strength of excitatory synapses in the BLA. Further reduced feed-forward inhibition appears to enhance synaptic plasticity in the FXS amygdala. These results demonstrate that plasticity is enhanced in the amygdala of the juvenile Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse and that E/I imbalance may underpin anxiety disorders commonly seen in FXS and ASDs.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105714630&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0113-21.2021&partnerID=40&md5=93409b722c8a1aeeb741789d25654a77","Neuroscience Graduate Program University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmaceutical Sciences Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMedical Scientist Training Program University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Cell and Developmental Biology University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentro de Investigación Biomédica y Aplicada Escuela de Medicina Facultad de Ciencias Médicas Universidad de Santiago de Chile Santiago 9160000 Chile.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeuroscience Graduate Program University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045 molly.huntsman@CUAnschutz.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pediatrics School of Medicine University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Aurora CO 80045.",2021,"10.1523/eneuro.0113-21.2021","Article","Amygdala/metabolismAnimalsDisease Models Animal*Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/metabolism*Fragile X Syndrome/geneticsMiceMice KnockoutSynapses/metabolismSynaptic TransmissionE/I balancefeed-forward inhibitionfragile X syndromelateral amygdalasynaptic plasticity","pubmed-33893168.pdf","pubmed-33893168","xml_texts/PMC8121259.xml","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0113-21.2021.txt","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0113-21.2021.pdf"

To investigate possible underlying mechanisms we generated enterocytes from PMDS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and used Caco-2 cells with knockdown of SHANK3. We detected decreased expression of Zn uptake transporters ZIP2 and ZIP4 on mRNA and protein level correlating with SHANK3 expression levels and found reduced levels of ZIP4 protein co-localizing with SHANK3 at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that especially ZIP4 exists in a complex with SHANK3.

The clinical severity of HPP varies widely, with symptoms including rickets and osteomalacia. TNALP knockout (Akp2-/-) mice phenotypically mimic the severe infantile form of HPP; that is, TNALP-deficient mice are born with a normal appearance but die by 20 days of age owing to growth failure, hypomineralization, and epileptic seizures. In this study, a lentiviral vector expressing a bone-targeted form of TNALP was injected into the jugular vein of newborn Akp2-/- mice. We found that alkaline phosphatase activity in the plasma of treated Akp2-/- mice increased and remained at high levels throughout the life of the animals.

"Deletion of PLCγ1 in GABAergic neurons increases seizure susceptibility in aged mice","Kim H. Y.Yang Y. R.Hwang H.Lee H. E.Jang H. J.Kim J.Yang E.Kim H.Rhim H.Suh P. G.Kim J. I.","Sci Rep",NA,"Synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in the information processing of neural circuits. It sculpts excitatory signals and prevents hyperexcitability of neurons. Owing to these essential functions dysregulated synaptic inhibition causes a plethora of neurological disorders including epilepsy autism and schizophrenia. Among these disorders epilepsy is associated with abnormal hyperexcitability of neurons caused by the deficits of GABAergic neuron or decreased GABAergic inhibition at synapses. Although many antiepileptic drugs are intended to improve GABA-mediated inhibition the molecular mechanisms of synaptic inhibition regulated by GABAergic neurons are not fully understood. Increasing evidence indicates that phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) is involved in the generation of seizure while the causal relationship between PLCγ1 and seizure has not been firmly established yet. Here we show that genetic deletion of PLCγ1 in GABAergic neurons leads to handling-induced seizure in aged mice. In addition aged Plcg1(F/F); Dlx5/6-Cre mice exhibit other behavioral alterations including hypoactivity reduced anxiety and fear memory deficit. Notably inhibitory synaptic transmission as well as the number of inhibitory synapses are decreased in the subregions of hippocampus. These findings suggest that PLCγ1 may be a key determinant of maintaining both inhibitory synapses and synaptic transmission potentially contributing to the regulation of E/I balance in the hippocampus.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075652032&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-54477-4&partnerID=40&md5=c8d3af06824df329425c3ecb345b0dee","School of Life Sciences Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) Ulsan 44919 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAging Research Center Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) Daejeon 34141 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Neuroscience Brain Science Institute Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Seoul 136-791 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKorea Brain Research Institute (KBRI) Daegu 41062 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Anatomy College of Medicine Korea University Seoul 136-705 Republic of Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSchool of Life Sciences Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) Ulsan 44919 Republic of Korea. pgsuh@kbri.re.kr.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKorea Brain Research Institute (KBRI) Daegu 41062 Republic of Korea. pgsuh@kbri.re.kr.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSchool of Life Sciences Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) Ulsan 44919 Republic of Korea. jikim220@unist.ac.kr.",2019,"10.1038/s41598-019-54477-4","Article","AgingAnimalsFemaleGABAergic Neurons/*metabolism/pathologyGene DeletionMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutPhospholipase C gamma/*geneticsSeizures/*genetics/pathology","pubmed-31780806.pdf","pubmed-31780806","xml_texts/PMC6882884.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-54477-4.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-54477-4.pdf"

In the present study we created inducible cartilage-specific PPAR gamma knockout (KO) mice and subjected these mice to the destabilisation of medial meniscus (DMM) model of osteoarthritis (OA) to elucidate the specific in vivo role of PPAR gamma in OA pathophysiology. We further investigated the downstream PPAR gamma signalling pathway responsible for maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Methods Inducible cartilage-specific PPAR gamma KO mice were generated and subjected to DMM model of OA. We also created inducible cartilage-specific PPAR gamma/mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR) double KO mice to dissect the PPAR gamma signalling pathway in OA. Results Compared with control mice PPAR gamma KO mice exhibit accelerated OA phenotype with increased cartilage degradation chondrocyte apoptosis and the overproduction of OA inflammatory/catabolic factors associated with the increased expression of mTOR and the suppression of key autophagy markers. In vitro rescue experiments using PPAR gamma expression vector reduced mTOR expression increased expression of autophagy markers and reduced the expression of OA inflammatory/catabolic factors thus reversing the phenotype of PPAR gamma KO mice chondrocytes. To dissect the in vivo role of mTOR pathway in PPAR gamma signalling we created and subjected PPAR gamma-mTOR double KO mice to the OA model to see if the genetic deletion of mTOR in PPAR gamma KO mice (double KO) can rescue the accelerated OA phenotype observed in PPAR gamma KO mice.

The pregnant mice were orally administered BPA (50 µg/kgbw/d) from gestation day (GD) 7 to postnatal day (PND) 21 and sesame oil was used as a vehicle control. In Morris water maze (MWM) test BPA extended the escape latency time to locate the hidden platform in 8 weeks male mice. RT-PCR and Immunoblotting results showed significant upregulation of Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 expression in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 8 weeks male mice. This was further substantiated by in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence techniques. BPA also significantly increased the density of dendritic spines in both regions as analyzed by rapid Golgi staining.

"A role for thrombospondin-1 deficits in astrocyte-mediated spine and synaptic pathology in Down's syndrome","Garcia O.Torres M.Helguera P.Coskun P.Busciglio J.","Plos one",NA,"BACKGROUND: Down's syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. Reduced number and aberrant architecture of dendritic spines are common features of DS neuropathology. However the mechanisms involved in DS spine alterations are not known. In addition to a relevant role in synapse formation and maintenance astrocytes can regulate spine dynamics by releasing soluble factors or by physical contact with neurons. We have previously shown impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes leading to metabolic alterations in protein processing and secretion. In this study we investigated whether deficits in astrocyte function contribute to DS spine pathology. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a human astrocyte/rat hippocampal neuron coculture we found that DS astrocytes are directly involved in the development of spine malformations and reduced synaptic density. We also show that thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) an astrocyte-secreted protein possesses a potent modulatory effect on spine number and morphology and that both DS brains and DS astrocytes exhibit marked deficits in TSP-1 protein expression. Depletion of TSP-1 from normal astrocytes resulted in dramatic changes in spine morphology while restoration of TSP-1 levels prevented DS astrocyte-mediated spine and synaptic alterations. Astrocyte cultures derived from TSP-1 KO mice exhibited similar deficits to support spine formation and structure than DS astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that human astrocytes promote spine and synapse formation identify astrocyte dysfunction as a significant factor of spine and synaptic pathology in the DS brain and provide a mechanistic rationale for the exploration of TSP-1-based therapies to treat spine and synaptic pathology in DS and other neurological conditions.",NA,"Department of Neurobiology and Behavior Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory University of California Irvine Irvine California United States of America.",2010,"10.1371/journal.pone.0014200","Article","AnimalsAnimals Genetically ModifiedAstrocytes/*cytologyBrain/embryologyCoculture TechniquesDendritic Spines/metabolismDown Syndrome/*metabolismGene Expression Regulation DevelopmentalHumansMicroscopy Fluorescence/methodsNeurons/metabolismRatsSynapses/*pathologyThrombospondin 1/*physiology","pubmed-21152035.pdf","pubmed-21152035","xml_texts/PMC2996288.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014200.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014200.pdf"

Profound congenital sensorineural hearing impairment can be due to an abnormal cochleovestibular nerve (CVN) and cochleovestibular malformations however the etiology of these conditions remains unclear. Methods: We used a trio-based exome sequencing approach to unravel the underlying molecular etiology of a child with a rare nonsyndromic CVN abnormality and cochlear hypoplasia. Clinical and imaging data were also reviewed. Results: We identified a de novo missense variant [p(Asn174Tyr)] in the DNA-binding Homeodomain of SIX1 a gene which previously has been associated with autosomal dominant hearing loss (ADHL) and branchio-oto-renal or Branchio-otic syndrome a condition not seen in this patient. Conclusions: SIX1 has an important function in otic vesicle patterning during embryogenesis and mice show several abnormalities to their inner ear including loss of inner ear innervation. Previous reports on patients with SIX1 variants lack imaging data and nonsyndromic AD cases were reported to have no inner ear malformations. In conclusion we show that a de novo variant in SIX1 in a patient with sensorineural hearing loss leads to cochleovestibular malformations and abnormalities of the CVN without any other abnormalities.

"Long-term potentiation can be induced in the CA1 region of hippocampus in the absence of αCaMKII T286-autophosphorylation","Villers A.; Giese K.P.; Ris L.","Learning and Memory",NA,"α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (αCaMKII) T286-autophosphorylation provides a short-term molecular memory that was thought to be required for LTP and for learning and memory. However, it has been shown that learning can occur in αCaMKII-T286A mutant mice after a massed training protocol. This raises the question of whether there might be a form of LTP in these mice that can occur without T286 autophosphorylation. In this study, we confirmed that in CA1 pyramidal cells, LTP induced in acute hippocampal slices, after a recovery period in an interface chamber, is strictly dependent on postsynaptic αCaMKII autophosphorylation. However, we demonstrated that αCaMKII-autophosphorylation-independent plasticity can occur in the hippocampus but at the expense of synaptic specificity. This nonspecific LTP was observed in mutant and wild-type mice after a recovery period in a submersion chamber and was independent of NMDA receptors. Moreover, when slices prepared from mutant mice were preincubated during 2 h with rapamycin, high-frequency trains induced a synapse-specific LTP which was added to the nonspecific LTP. This specific LTP was related to an increase in the duration and the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated response induced by rapamycin. © 2014 Villers et al.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84910151336&doi=10.1101%2flm.035972.114&partnerID=40&md5=33d499a9258902a3fa3d76ea77ac882c","Department of Neuroscience, Research Institute for Biosciences, University of Mons, Mons, B-7000, Belgium; MRC Centre for Neurodegeneration, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, SE5 9NU, United Kingdom",2014,"10.1101/lm.035972.114","Article","Animals; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; Long-Term Potentiation; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Phosphorylation; Pyramidal Cells; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Sirolimus; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; rapamycin; unclassified drug; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; mTOR protein, mouse; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; rapamycin; target of rapamycin kinase; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autophosphorylation; calcium transport; controlled study; excitatory postsynaptic potential; hippocampal CA1 region; long term potentiation; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nerve excitability; nonhuman; postsynaptic potential; pyramidal nerve cell; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; drug effects; hippocampal CA1 region; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology","scopus-84910151336.pdf","scopus-84910151336","xml_texts/PMC4201817.xml","full_texts/10.1101%2Flm.035972.114.txt","full_texts/10.1101%2Flm.035972.114.pdf"

"Synaptic Dysfunction by Mutations in GRIN2B: Influence of Triheteromeric NMDA Receptors on Gain-Of-Function and Loss-Of-Function Mutant Classification","Elmasri M., Lotti J.S., Aziz W., Steele O.G., Karachaliou E., Sakimura K., Hansen K.B., Penn A.C.","Brain Sciences",NA,"GRIN2B mutations are rare but often associated with patients having severe neurodevel-opmental disorders with varying range of symptoms such as intellectual disability, developmental delay and epilepsy. Patient symptoms likely arise from mutations disturbing the role that the en-coded NMDA receptor subunit, GluN2B, plays at neuronal connections in the developing nervous system. In this study, we investigated the cell-autonomous effects of putative gain-(GoF) and loss-of-function (LoF) missense GRIN2B mutations on excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices. In the absence of both native GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, functional incorporation into synaptic NMDA receptors was attenuated for GoF mutants, or almost eliminated for LoF GluN2B mutants. NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA-EPSCs) from synaptic GoF GluN1/2B receptors had prolonged decays consistent with their functional classification. Nonetheless, in the presence of native GluN2A, molecular replacement of native GluN2B with GoF and LoF GluN2B mutants all led to similar functional incorporation into synaptic receptors, more rapidly decaying NMDA-EPSCs and greater inhibition by TCN-201, a selective antagonist for GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors. Mechanistic insight was gained from experiments in HEK293T cells, which revealed that GluN2B GoF mutants slowed deactivation in diheteromeric GluN1/2B, but not triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B receptors. We also show that a dis-ease-associated missense mutation, which severely affects surface expression, causes opposing effects on NMDA-EPSC decay and charge transfer when introduced into GluN2A or GluN2B. Finally, we show that having a single null Grin2b allele has only a modest effect on NMDA-EPSC decay kinetics. Our results demonstrate that functional incorporation of GoF and LoF GluN2B mutants into synaptic receptors and the effects on EPSC decay times are highly dependent on the presence of triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B NMDA receptors, thereby influencing the functional classification of NMDA receptor variants as GoF or LoF mutations. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting effects of disease-causing NMDA receptor missense mutations in the context of neuronal function. © 2022 by the authors.

"Agenesis and Hypomyelination of Corpus Callosum in Mice Lacking Nsun5 an RNA Methyltransferase","Yuan Z.Chen P.Zhang T.Shen B.Chen L.","Cells",NA,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is caused by microdeletions of 28 genes and is characterized by cognitive disorder and hypotrophic corpus callosum (CC). Nsun5 gene which encodes cytosine-5 RNA methyltransferase is located in the deletion loci of WBS. We have reported that single-gene knockout of Nsun5 (Nsun5-KO) in mice impairs spatial cognition. Herein we report that postnatal day (PND) 60 Nsun5-KO mice showed the volumetric reduction of CC with a decline in the number of myelinated axons and loose myelin sheath. Nsun5 was highly expressed in callosal oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) from PND7 to PND28.

Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses of myelin basic protein (MBP) showed the hypomyelination in the CC of PND28 Nsun5-KO mice. The Nsun5 deletion suppressed the proliferation of OPCs but did not affect transition of radial glial cells into OPCs or cell cycle exit of OPCs. The protein levels rather than transcriptional levels of CDK1 CDK2 and Cdc42 in the CC of PND7 and PND14 Nsun5-KO mice were reduced.

"Endoplasmic reticulum retention and degradation of a mutation in SLC6A1 associated with epilepsy and autism","Wang J., Poliquin S., Mermer F., Eissman J., Delpire E., Wang J., Shen W., Cai K., Li B.-M., Li Z.-Y., Xu D., Nwosu G., Flamm C., Liao W.-P., Shi Y.-W., Kang J.-Q.","Molecular Brain",NA,"Mutations in SLC6A1, encoding γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT-1), have been recently associated with a spectrum of epilepsy syndromes, intellectual disability and autism in clinic. However, the pathophysiology of the gene mutations is far from clear. Here we report a novel SLC6A1 missense mutation in a patient with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder and characterized the molecular defects of the mutant GAT-1, from transporter protein trafficking to GABA uptake function in heterologous cells and neurons. The heterozygous missense mutation (c1081C to A (P361T)) in SLC6A1 was identified by exome sequencing. We have thoroughly characterized the molecular pathophysiology underlying the clinical phenotypes. We performed EEG recordings and autism diagnostic interview. The patient had neurodevelopmental delay, absence epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, and 2.5-3 Hz generalized spike and slow waves on EEG recordings. The impact of the mutation on GAT-1 function and trafficking was evaluated by 3H GABA uptake, structural simulation with machine learning tools, live cell confocal microscopy and protein expression in mouse neurons and nonneuronal cells. We demonstrated that the GAT-1(P361T) mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation and reduces total protein expression. The mutant transporter protein was localized intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a pattern of expression very similar to the cells treated with tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer. Radioactive 3H-labeled GABA uptake assay indicated the mutation reduced the function of the mutant GAT-1(P361T), to a level that is similar to the cells treated with GAT-1 inhibitors. In summary, this mutation destabilizes the mutant transporter protein, which results in retention of the mutant protein inside cells and reduction of total transporter expression, likely via excessive endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation. This thus likely causes reduced functional transporter number on the cell surface, which then could cause the observed reduced GABA uptake function. Consequently, malfunctioning GABA signaling may cause altered neurodevelopment and neurotransmission, such as enhanced tonic inhibition and altered cell proliferation in vivo. The pathophysiology due to severely impaired GAT-1 function may give rise to a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism and epilepsy. © 2020 The Author(s).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084567539&doi=10.1186%2fs13041-020-00612-6&partnerID=40&md5=40044b3ed67ce39486d6429bb4ceafb2","Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Key Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Channelopathies of Guangdong Province, Ministry of Education of China, Guangzhou, 510260, China; Neuroscience Program, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN  37232, United States; Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN  37232, United States; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Christopher S.

Here we report that unexpectedly constitutive activation of mTOR signalling by Tsc1 deletion in the oligodendrocyte lineage results in severe myelination defects and oligodendrocyte cell death in mice despite an initial increase of oligodendrocyte precursors during early development. Expression profiling analysis reveals that Tsc1 ablation induces prominent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses by activating a PERK-eIF2 alpha signalling axis and Fas-JNK apoptotic pathways. Enhancement of the phospho-eIF2 alpha adaptation pathway by inhibition of Gadd34-PP1 phosphatase with guanabenz protects oligodendrocytes and partially rescues myelination defects in Tsc1 mutants. Thus TSC1-mTOR signalling acts as an important checkpoint for maintaining oligodendrocyte homoeostasis pointing to a previously uncharacterized ER stress mechanism that contributes to hypomyelination in tuberous sclerosis.",NA,NA,2016,"10.1038/ncomms12185","Article",NA,"wos-000380781500001.pdf","wos-000380781500001","xml_texts/PMC4947172.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fncomms12185.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fncomms12185.pdf"

"Liver kinase B-1 modulates the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and regulates social memory formation","Yu, M; Sun, FJ; Xiang, G; Zhang, YH; Wang, XJ; Liu, X; Huang, B; Li, XG; Zhang, D","FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE",NA,"Social memory is the ability to discriminate between familiar and unknown conspecifics. It is an important component of social cognition and is therefore essential for the establishment of social relationships. Although the neural circuit mechanisms underlying social memory encoding have been well investigated, little focus has been placed on the regulatory mechanisms of social memory processing. The dopaminergic system, originating from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), is a key modulator of cognitive function. This study aimed to illustrate its role in modulating social memory and explore the possible molecular mechanisms. Here, we show that the activation of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons is required for the formation, but not the retrieval, of social memory. Inhibition of VTA DA neurons before social interaction, but not 24 h after social interaction, significantly impaired social discrimination the following day. In addition, we showed that the activation of VTA DA neurons was regulated by the serine/threonine protein kinase liver kinase B1 (Lkb1). Deletion of Lkb1 in VTA DA neurons reduced the frequency of burst firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, Lkb1 plays an important role in regulating social behaviors. Both genetic and virus-mediated deletions of Lkb1 in the VTA of adult mice impaired social memory and subsequently attenuated social familiarization. Altogether, our results provide direct evidence linking social memory formation to the activation of VTA DA neurons in mice and illustrate the crucial role of Lkb1 in regulating VTA DA neuron function.",NA,"Shandong University; Shandong University; Jinan Microecological Biomedicine Shandong Laboratory; Binzhou Medical University",2024,"10.3389/fnmol.2024.1289476","Article","HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; LKB1; PATHWAY; REWARD; REGION; AUTISM; IDENTIFICATION; POLARIZATION; POTENTIATION","wos-001204939500001.pdf","wos-001204939500001","xml_texts/PMC11026561.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2024.1289476.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2024.1289476.pdf"

One prevalent hypothesis is that hyperphosphorylation misfolding and fibrillization of tau impair synaptic plasticity and cause degeneration. However tau pathology may also result in the loss of specific physiological tau functions which are largely unknown but could contribute to neuronal dysfunction. In the present study we uncovered a novel function of tau in its ability to regulate brain insulin signaling. We found that tau deletion leads to an impaired hippocampal response to insulin caused by altered IRS-1 and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10) activities. Our data also demonstrate that tau knockout mice exhibit an impaired hypothalamic anorexigenic effect of insulin that is associated with energy metabolism alterations. Consistently we found that tau haplotypes are associated with glycemic traits in humans. The present data have far-reaching clinical implications and raise the hypothesis that pathophysiological tau loss-of-function favors brain insulin resistance which is instrumental for cognitive and metabolic impairments in Alzheimer's disease patients.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027337943&doi=10.1084%2fjem.20161731&partnerID=40&md5=b299bb244d835341d980d137bb910978","Université de Lille Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) CHU Lille UMR-S 1172 JPArc Lille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLabEx DISTALZ (Development of Innovative Strategies for a Transdisciplinary approach to ALZheimer's disease) Lille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLaboratory of Biological Psychology Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences KU Leuven Leuven Belgium.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeurological Disorders Research Center Qatar Biomedical Research Institute Hamad Bin Khalifa University Doha Qatar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversité de Lille INSERM CHU Lille Institut Pasteur de Lille U1011EGID Lille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversité de Lille INSERM CHU Lille Institut Pasteur de Lille U1167 RID-AGE Facteurs de Risque et Déterminants Moléculaires des Maladies Liées au Vieillissement Lille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rINSERM U1016 CNRS UMR8104 Université Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cité Institut Cochin Paris France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Experimental Neurodegeneration Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain University Medical Center Goettingen Goettingen Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversité de Lille Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) CHU Lille UMR-S 1172 JPArc Lille France david.blum@inserm.fr.",2017,"10.1084/jem.20161731","Article","AnimalsBrain/*metabolism/physiologyCognitive Dysfunction/etiologyHaplotypesHippocampus/physiologyHumansInsulin/physiology*Insulin ResistanceMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice Knockouttau Proteins/*physiology","pubmed-28652303.pdf","pubmed-28652303","xml_texts/PMC5551570.xml","full_texts/10.1084%2Fjem.20161731.txt","full_texts/10.1084%2Fjem.20161731.pdf"

"Deep phenotyping reveals movement phenotypes in mouse neurodevelopmental models","Klibaite U.Kislin M.Verpeut J. L.Bergeler S.Sun X.Shaevitz J. W.Wang S. S.","Mol Autism",NA,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive action resistance to environmental change and fine motor disruptions are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders and vary considerably from individual to individual. In animal models conventional behavioral phenotyping captures such fine-scale variations incompletely. Here we observed male and female C57BL/6J mice to methodically catalog adaptive movement over multiple days and examined two rodent models of developmental disorders against this dynamic baseline. We then investigated the behavioral consequences of a cerebellum-specific deletion in Tsc1 protein and a whole-brain knockout in Cntnap2 protein in mice. Both of these mutations are found in clinical conditions and have been associated with ASD. METHODS: We used advances in computer vision and deep learning namely a generalized form of high-dimensional statistical analysis to develop a framework for characterizing mouse movement on multiple timescales using a single popular behavioral assay the open-field test. The pipeline takes virtual markers from pose estimation to find behavior clusters and generate wavelet signatures of behavior classes. We measured spatial and temporal habituation to a new environment across minutes and days different types of self-grooming locomotion and gait. RESULTS: Both Cntnap2 knockouts and L7-Tsc1 mutants showed forelimb lag during gait. L7-Tsc1 mutants and Cntnap2 knockouts showed complex defects in multi-day adaptation lacking the tendency of wild-type mice to spend progressively more time in corners of the arena. In L7-Tsc1 mutant mice failure to adapt took the form of maintained ambling turning and locomotion and an overall decrease in grooming. However adaptation in these traits was similar between wild-type mice and Cntnap2 knockouts. L7-Tsc1 mutant and Cntnap2 knockout mouse models showed different patterns of behavioral state occupancy. LIMITATIONS: Genetic risk factors for autism are numerous and we tested only two. Our pipeline was only done under conditions of free behavior. Testing under task or social conditions would reveal more information about behavioral dynamics and variability. CONCLUSIONS: Our automated pipeline for deep phenotyping successfully captures model-specific deviations in adaptation and movement as well as differences in the detailed structure of behavioral dynamics. The reported deficits indicate that deep phenotyping constitutes a robust set of ASD symptoms that may be considered for implementation in clinical settings as quantitative diagnosis criteria.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126210487&doi=10.1186%2fs13229-022-00492-8&partnerID=40&md5=1c4b27561a3a8329b3717c223de44973","Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Harvard University 52 Oxford St 02138 Cambridge MA USA. klibaite@fas.harvard.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPrinceton Neuroscience Institute Princeton University Washington Rd 08544 Princeton NJ USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physics Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics Princeton University Washington Rd 08544 Princeton NJ USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physics Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics Princeton University Washington Rd 08544 Princeton NJ USA. shaevitz@princeton.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPrinceton Neuroscience Institute Princeton University Washington Rd 08544 Princeton NJ USA. sswang@princeton.edu.",2022,"10.1186/s13229-022-00492-8","Article","Animals*Autism Spectrum Disorder/geneticsDisease Models AnimalFemaleMale*Membrane Proteins/geneticsMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice Knockout*Nerve Tissue Proteins/geneticsPhenotype*Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein/geneticsAutismBehaviorCerebellumClusteringMousePose estimation","pubmed-35279205.pdf","pubmed-35279205","xml_texts/PMC8917660.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00492-8.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00492-8.pdf"

This report demonstrates that both deficiency and overexpression of Men1 (protein: menin, a pathogenic gene of MEN1 syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) lead to autism-like behaviors, such as social defects, increased repetitive behaviors, and cognitive impairments. Multifaceted transcriptome analyses revealed that Foxg1 signaling is predominantly altered in Men1 deficiency mice, through its regulation of the Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked (Atrx) factor. Atrx recruits menin to bind to the transcriptional start region of Foxg1 and mediates the regulation of Foxg1 expression by H3K4me3 (Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4) modification. The deficits observed in menin deficient mice are rescued by the over-expression of Foxg1, leading to normalized spine growth and restoration of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that menin may have a putative role in the maintenance of Foxg1 expression, highlighting menin signaling as a potential therapeutic target for Foxg1-related encephalopathy.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38582517",NA,2024,"10.1002/advs.202307953","Article","ASD‐like behaviors; Atrx; FOXG1 syndrome; menin","pubmed-38582517.pdf","pubmed-38582517","xml_texts/PMC11200012.xml","full_texts/10.1002%2Fadvs.202307953.txt","full_texts/10.1002%2Fadvs.202307953.pdf"
"Ancestry of the AUTS2 family-A novel group of polycomb-complex proteins involved in human neurological disease","Sellers R. A.Robertson D. L.Tassabehji M.","Plos one",NA,"Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) is a neurodevelopmental regulator associated with an autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome AUTS2 syndrome and is implicated as an important gene in human-specific evolution. AUTS2 exists as part of a tripartite gene family the AUTS2 family which includes two relatively undefined proteins Fibrosin (FBRS) and Fibrosin-like protein 1 (FBRSL1). Evolutionary ancestors of AUTS2 have not been formally identified outside of the Animalia clade. A Drosophila melanogaster protein Tay bridge with a role in neurodevelopment has been shown to display limited similarity to the C-terminal of AUTS2 suggesting that evolutionary ancestors of the AUTS2 family may exist within other Protostome lineages. Here we present an evolutionary analysis of the AUTS2 family which highlights ancestral homologs of AUTS2 in multiple Protostome species implicates AUTS2 as the closest human relative to the progenitor of the AUTS2 family and demonstrates that Tay bridge is a divergent ortholog of the ancestral AUTS2 progenitor gene. We also define regions of high relative sequence identity with potential functional significance shared by the extended AUTS2 protein family. Using structural predictions coupled with sequence conservation and human variant data from 15708 individuals a putative domain structure for AUTS2 was produced that can be used to aid interpretation of the consequences of nucleotide variation on protein structure and function in human disease. To assess the role of AUTS2 in human-specific evolution we recalculated allele frequencies at previously identified human derived sites using large population genome data and show a high prevalence of ancestral alleles suggesting that AUTS2 may not be a rapidly evolving gene as previously thought.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097797933&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0232101&partnerID=40&md5=06ac7c90613e346b3d2d2b39faf11bbf","Evolution & Genomic Sciences School of Biological Sciences University of Manchester Manchester United Kingdom.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research Garscube Campus Glasgow United Kingdom.",2020,"10.1371/journal.pone.0232101","Article","AnimalsCytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics/metabolismDrosophila melanogaster/genetics*Evolution MolecularGenome/geneticsHumansLymphokines/genetics/metabolismNuclear Proteins/geneticsPhylogenyPolycomb-Group Proteins/geneticsSequence Homology Nucleic AcidTranscription Factors/*genetics/metabolism","pubmed-33306672.pdf","pubmed-33306672","xml_texts/PMC7732068.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0232101.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0232101.pdf"

Here, we report a homozygous one base-pair deletion, c.1193delT (p.Leu398Glnfs*2), in the Kinesin Family Member 6 (KIF6) gene in a child displaying neurodevelopmental defects and intellectual disability. To test the pathogenicity of this novel human KIF6 mutation we engineered an analogous C-terminal truncating mutation in mouse. These mutant mice display severe, postnatal-onset hydrocephalus. We generated a Kif6-LacZ transgenic mouse strain and report expression specifically and uniquely within the ependymal cells (ECs) of the brain, without labeling other multiciliated mouse tissues. Analysis of Kif6 mutant mice with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence (IF) revealed specific defects in the formation of EC cilia, without obvious effect of cilia of other multiciliated tissues. Dilation of the ventricular system and defects in the formation of EC cilia were also observed in adult kif6 mutant zebrafish. Finally, we report Kif6-GFP localization at the axoneme and basal bodies of multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) of the mucociliary Xenopus epidermis. Overall, this work describes the first clinically-defined KIF6 homozygous null mutation in human and defines KIF6 as a conserved mediator of neurological development with a specific role for EC ciliogenesis in vertebrates. © 2018 Konjikusic et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058014588&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1007817&partnerID=40&md5=8a65fcbfec807e7735bc9e3675f1d7e6","Department of Pediatrics, Dell Pediatric Research Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, Dell Medical School, Austin, TX, United States; Department of Molecular Biosciences, Patterson Labs, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States; Center of Excellence for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; Excellence Center for Medical Genetics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand; Division of Human Genetics, Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand; Program in Developmental & Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Neurology, Division Pediatric Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, United States",2018,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1007817","Article","green fluorescent protein; KIF6 protein, human; kinesin; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; axoneme; brain ventricle dilatation; carboxy terminal sequence; cell maturation; ciliogenesis; controlled study; ependyma cell; female; gene; gene expression; gene mutation; human; hydrocephalus; immunofluorescence; in vivo study; KIF6 gene; kinetosome; male; mouse; mouse mutant; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; pathogenicity; protein localization; scanning electron microscopy; transgenic mouse; abnormalities; amino acid sequence; animal; case report; child; cilium; consanguinity; deficiency; ependyma; gene deletion; genetics; homozygote; intellectual impairment; mental disease; metabolism; mutation; nucleotide sequence; pathology; pedigree; physiology; tissue distribution; transgenic animal; Xenopus laevis; zebra fish; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Base Sequence; Child; Cilia; Consanguinity; Ependyma; Female; Gene Expression; Homozygote; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Intellectual Disability; Kinesin; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Models, Animal; Mutation; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Pedigree; Sequence Deletion; Tissue Distribution; Xenopus laevis; Zebrafish","scopus-85058014588.pdf","scopus-85058014588","xml_texts/PMC6307780.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1007817.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1007817.pdf"
"TSPYL2 Regulates the Expression of EZH2 Target Genes in Neurons","Liu H.Peng L.So J.Tsang K. H.Chong C. H.Mak P. H. S.Chan K. M.Chan S. Y.","Mol Neurobiol",NA,"Testis-specific protein Y-encoded-like 2 (TSPYL2) is an X-linked gene in the locus for several neurodevelopmental disorders. We have previously shown that Tspyl2 knockout mice had impaired learning and sensorimotor gating and TSPYL2 facilitates the expression of Grin2a and Grin2b through interaction with CREB-binding protein. To identify other genes regulated by TSPYL2 here we showed that Tspyl2 knockout mice had an increased level of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the hippocampus and TSPYL2 interacted with the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in primary hippocampal neurons and divided all Refseq genes by k-mean clustering into four clusters from highest level of H3K27me3 to unmarked. We confirmed that mutant neurons had an increased level of H3K27me3 in cluster 1 genes which consist of known EZH2 target genes important in development. We detected significantly reduced expression of genes including Gbx2 and Prss16 from cluster 1 and Acvrl1 Bdnf Egr3 Grin2c and Igf1 from cluster 2 in the mutant. In support of a dynamic role of EZH2 in repressing marked synaptic genes the specific EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 significantly upregulated while the demethylase inhibitor GSKJ4 downregulated the expression of Egr3 and Grin2c. GSK126 also upregulated the expression of Bdnf in mutant primary neurons. Finally ChIP showed that hemagglutinin-tagged TSPYL2 co-existed with EZH2 in target promoters in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together our data suggest that TSPYL2 is recruited to promoters of specific EZH2 target genes in neurons and enhances their expression for proper neuronal maturation and function.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050668636&doi=10.1007%2fs12035-018-1238-y&partnerID=40&md5=f9a458844b963c5080a62f1c190313ac","Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUniversity Research Facility in Chemical and Environmental Analysis The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPeter MacCallum Cancer Centre Melbourne VIC Australia.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rResearch and Development Clinical Projects and Development New B Innovation Hong Kong China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biomedical Sciences the City University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China. ming.chan@cityu.edu.hk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKey Laboratory of Biochip Technology Biotech and Health Centre Shenzhen Research Institute of City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen China. ming.chan@cityu.edu.hk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China. sychan@hku.hk.",2019,"10.1007/s12035-018-1238-y","Article","AnimalsCell Cycle ProteinsEnhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*metabolism*Gene Expression RegulationGene OntologyHEK293 CellsHistones/metabolismHumansLysine/metabolismMaleMethylationMiceModels GeneticNeurons/*metabolismNuclear Proteins/*metabolismPromoter Regions Genetic/geneticsProtein BindingTranscription GeneticEzh2EpigeneticsH3K27me3NeuronsNucleosome assembly proteinTspyl2","pubmed-30051352.pdf","pubmed-30051352","xml_texts/PMC6459796.xml","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs12035-018-1238-y.txt","full_texts/10.1007%2Fs12035-018-1238-y.pdf"

Here we describe a novel role for ankyrin-G in neural progenitor proliferation in the developing cortex. We found that ankyrin-G regulates canonical Wnt signaling by altering the subcellular localization and availability of β-catenin in proliferating cells. Ankyrin-G loss-of-function increases β-catenin levels in the nucleus thereby promoting neural progenitor proliferation. Importantly abnormalities in proliferation can be rescued by reducing Wnt pathway signaling.

We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7-11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found.

Despite the importance of SHANK3 as a paradigmatic gene mediating neurodevelopmental disorders its psychological effects in nonclinical populations have yet to be studied. We genotyped the nonsynonymous functional SHANK3 SNP rs9616915 in a large population of typical individuals scored for autism spectrum traits (the Autism Quotient AQ) and schizotypy spectrum traits (the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire SPQ-BR). Males but not females showed significant genotypic effects for the SPQ-BR subscale associated with speech and language: Odd Speech. These findings in conjunction with animal model studies showing vocalization and auditory effects of SHANK3 mutations and studies indicating severe language alterations and speech-associated white matter tract abnormalities in Phelan-McDermid syndrome suggest that SHANK3 differentially affects the development and expression of human language and speech.

"Deletion of glutamate delta-1 receptor in mouse leads to aberrant emotional and social behaviors","Yadav R.Gupta S. C.Hillman B. G.Bhatt J. M.Stairs D. J.Dravid S. M.","Plos one",NA,"The delta family of ionotropic glutamate receptors consists of glutamate δ1 (GluD1) and glutamate δ2 (GluD2) receptors. While the role of GluD2 in the regulation of cerebellar physiology is well understood the function of GluD1 in the central nervous system remains elusive. We demonstrate for the first time that deletion of GluD1 leads to abnormal emotional and social behaviors. We found that GluD1 knockout mice (GluD1 KO) were hyperactive manifested lower anxiety-like behavior depression-like behavior in a forced swim test and robust aggression in the resident-intruder test. Chronic lithium rescued the depression-like behavior in GluD1 KO. GluD1 KO mice also manifested deficits in social interaction. In the sociability test GluD1 KO mice spent more time interacting with an inanimate object compared to a conspecific mouse. D-Cycloserine (DCS) administration was able to rescue social interaction deficits observed in GluD1 KO mice. At a molecular level synaptoneurosome preparations revealed lower GluA1 and GluA2 subunit expression in the prefrontal cortex and higher GluA1 GluK2 and PSD95 expression in the amygdala of GluD1 KO. Moreover DCS normalized the lower GluA1 expression in prefrontal cortex of GluD1 KO. We propose that deletion of GluD1 leads to aberrant circuitry in prefrontal cortex and amygdala owing to its potential role in presynaptic differentiation and synapse formation.

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from male patients harboring mutations in MECP2 along with control lines from their unaffected fathers give us an opportunity to identify some of the earliest cellular and molecular changes associated with MECP2 loss-of-function (LOF). We differentiated iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) using retinoic acid (RA) and found that astrocyte differentiation is perturbed in iPSC lines derived from two different patients. Using highly stringent quantitative proteomic analyses we found that LIN28 a gene important for cell fate regulation and developmental timing is upregulated in mutant NPCs compared to WT controls. Overexpression of LIN28 protein in control NPCs suppressed astrocyte differentiation and reduced neuronal synapse density whereas downregulation of LIN28 expression in mutant NPCs partially rescued this synaptic deficiency.

"PRMT7 deficiency causes dysregulation of the HCN channels in the CA1 pyramidal cells and impairment of social behaviors","Lee S. Y.Vuong T. A.So H. K.Kim H. J.Kim Y. B.Kang J. S.Kwon I.Cho H.","Exp Mol Med",NA,"HCN channels regulate excitability and rhythmicity in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Perturbation in the HCN channel current (I(h)) is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders. Recently protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) was shown to be highly expressed in the hippocampus including the CA1 region. However the physiological function of PRMT7 in the CA1 neurons and the relationship to psychiatric disorders are unclear. Here we showed that PRMT7 knockout (KO) mice exhibit hyperactivity and deficits in social interaction. The firing frequency of the CA1 neurons in the PRMT7 KO mice was significantly higher than that in the wild-type (WT) mice. Compared with the WT CA1 neurons the PRMT7 KO CA1 neurons showed a more hyperpolarized resting potential and a higher input resistance which were occluded by the I(h)-current inhibitor ZD7288; these findings were consistent with the decreased I(h) and suggested the contribution of I(h)-channel dysfunction to the PRMT7 KO phenotypes. The HCN1 protein level was decreased in the CA1 region of the PRMT7 KO mice in conjunction with a decrease in the expression of Shank3 which encodes a core scaffolding protein for HCN channel proteins. A brief application of the PRMT7 inhibitor DS437 did not reproduce the phenotype of the PRMT7 KO neurons further indicating that PRMT7 regulates I(h) by controlling the channel number rather than the open probability. Moreover shRNA-mediated PRMT7 suppression reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of SHANK3 implying that PRMT7 deficiency might be responsible for the decrease in the HCN protein levels by altering Shank3 expression. These findings reveal a key role for PRMT7 in the regulation of HCN channel density in the CA1 pyramidal cells that may be amenable to pharmacological intervention for neuropsychiatric disorders.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083368249&doi=10.1038%2fs12276-020-0417-x&partnerID=40&md5=983947bffbe31efe00eae719db974674","Department of Physiology Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSingle Cell Network Research Center Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular Cell Biology Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Anatomy and Cell Biology Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea. ilmin.kwon@skku.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Physiology Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea. hanacho@skku.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSingle Cell Network Research Center Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine Suwon Korea. hanacho@skku.edu.",2020,"10.1038/s12276-020-0417-x","Article","Action PotentialsAnimalsBehavior AnimalBiomarkersCA1 Region Hippocampal/*metabolism/*physiopathologyCell Line*Gene Expression RegulationHumansHyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels/*genetics/metabolismMiceMice KnockoutPatch-Clamp TechniquesProtein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*deficiencyPyramidal Cells/metabolism*Social Behavior","pubmed-32269286.pdf","pubmed-32269286","xml_texts/PMC7210990.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs12276-020-0417-x.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs12276-020-0417-x.pdf"

L.","Nat Neurosci",NA,"Some autistic individuals exhibit abnormal development of the caudate nucleus and associative cortical areas suggesting potential dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia (BG) circuits. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches in mice we identified a narrow postnatal period that is characterized by extensive glutamatergic synaptogenesis in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and a concomitant increase in corticostriatal circuit activity. SPNs during early development have high intrinsic excitability and respond strongly to cortical afferents despite sparse excitatory inputs. As a result striatum and corticostriatal connectivity are highly sensitive to acute and chronic changes in cortical activity suggesting that early imbalances in cortical function alter BG development. Indeed a mouse model of autism with deletions in Shank3 (Shank3B(-/-)) shows early cortical hyperactivity which triggers increased SPN excitatory synapse and corticostriatal hyperconnectivity. These results indicate that there is a tight functional coupling between cortex and striatum during early postnatal development and suggest a potential common circuit dysfunction that is caused by cortical hyperactivity.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959249189&doi=10.1038%2fnn.4260&partnerID=40&md5=87aa0eb8b5e6a9385b4d74b40ce13fd4","Department of Neurobiology Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard Medical School Boston Massachusetts USA.",2016,"10.1038/nn.4260","Article","Action Potentials/physiologyAnimalsAutistic Disorder/genetics/physiopathologyCerebral Cortex/*growth & development/*physiology/physiopathologyCorpus Striatum/*growth & development/*physiologyDisease Models AnimalFemaleMaleMiceMice KnockoutMice TransgenicMicrofilament ProteinsNerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*physiologyNeural Pathways/growth & development/physiopathologyNeurons/physiologySynapses/physiology","pubmed-26928064.pdf","pubmed-26928064","xml_texts/PMC4846490.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fnn.4260.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fnn.4260.pdf"

Despite their core symptoms, these conditions exhibits comparable component traits, an anxiety. In this study, we explored the effect of exercise on behavioral abnormalities in psychiatric conditions, focusing on its intensity and emotional resilience. Shank3B knockout (KO SED ) mice displaying self-injurious repetitive behavior and C57BL/6J mice, susceptible to stress as ASD and depression model, respectively, were subjected to moderate-intensity exercise (ME) for 2 weeks. ME mitigated the core symptoms (excessive grooming traits and behavioral despair) but did not exert a significant anxiolytic effect. Notably, exercise intensity has emerged as a critical determinant of its efficacy, as evidenced by a lower ventilation threshold and anxiolytic effect mediated by low-intensity exercise.

"Neuroligin 1 modulates striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission in a pathway and NMDAR subunit-specific manner","Espinosa F.Xuan Z.Liu S.Powell C. M.","Front Synaptic Neurosci",NA,"Together with its presynaptic partner Neurexin 1 (Nxn1) Neuroligin 1 (NL1) participates in synapse specification and synapse maintenance. We and others have shown that NL1 can also modulate glutamatergic synaptic function in the central nervous system of rodent models. These molecular/cellular changes can translate into altered animal behaviors that are thought to be analogous to symptomatology of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example in dorsal striatum of NL1 deletion mice we previously reported that the ratio N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic currents to α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR) mediated synaptic currents (NMDA/AMPA) is reduced in medium spiny neuron (MSNs). Importantly this reduction in NMDA/AMPA ratio correlated with increased repetitive grooming. The striatum is the input nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG). Classical models of this circuitry imply that there are two principal pathways that render distinct and somewhat opposite striatal outputs critical to the function of these nuclei in modulating motor behavior. Thus we set out to better characterize the effects of NL1 deletion on direct and indirect pathways of the dorsal striatum by genetically labeling MSNs participating in the direct and indirect pathways. We demonstrate that a decrease in NMDAR-mediated currents is limited to MSNs of the direct pathway. Furthermore the decrease in NMDAR-mediated currents is largely due to a reduction in function of NMDARs containing the GluN2A subunit. In contrast indirect pathway MSNs in NL1 knockout (KO) mice showed a reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory neurotransmission not observed in the direct pathway. Thus NL1 deletion differentially affects direct and indirect pathway MSNs in dorsal striatum. These findings have potential implications for striatal function in NL1 KO mice.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948945935&doi=10.3389%2ffnsyn.2015.00011&partnerID=40&md5=b3f80fae5e4bdca356491dcbaa37078a","Department of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas TX USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas TX USA ; Neuroscience Graduate Program The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas TX USA ; Department of Psychiatry The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas TX USA.",2015,"10.3389/fnsyn.2015.00011","Article","GluN2AGluN2BNmdaNeuroligin 1autism spectrum disordersmEPSCmedium spiny neuron (MSN)synaptic transmission","pubmed-26283958.pdf","pubmed-26283958","xml_texts/PMC4518159.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnsyn.2015.00011.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnsyn.2015.00011.pdf"
"Contactin-1/F3 Regulates Neuronal Migration and Morphogenesis Through Modulating RhoA Activity","Chen, YA; Lu, IL; Tsai, JW","FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE",NA,"During neocortical development, newborn neurons migrate along radial fibers from the germinal ventricular zone (VZ) toward the cortical plate (CP) to populate the cerebral cortex. This radial migration requires adhesion activities between neurons and radial fibers; however, past research has identified only a limited number of adhesion molecules involved in this process. Contactin-1/F3 (Cntn1), a cell adhesion molecule expressed in the developing nervous system is essential for many key developmental events including neural cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, axon guidance and myelination. However, the potential role of Cntn1 in neuronal migration during cortical development has not been investigated. Here we used in utero electroporation to introduce short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down (KD) Cntn1 in neural stem cells in vivo. We found that Cntn1 KD led to a delay in neuronal migration. The arrested cells presented abnormal morphology in their leading process and more multipolar cells were observed in the deep layers of the brain, suggestive of dysregulation in process formation. Intriguingly, Cntn1 KD also resulted in upregulation of RhoA, a negative regulator for neuronal migration. Interference of RhoA by expression of the dominant - negative RhoA(N19) partially rescued the neuronal migration defects caused by Cntn1 KD. Our results showed that Cntn1 is a novel adhesion protein that is essential for neuronal migration and regulates process formation of newborn cortical neurons through modulating RhoA signaling pathway.",NA,NA,2018,"10.3389/fnmol.2018.00422","Article",NA,"wos-000450705500001.pdf","wos-000450705500001","xml_texts/PMC6255823.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00422.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00422.pdf"

Independent studies in multiple species suggest that the striatum is a key site of FOXP2 action. Here we used in vivo recordings in awake-behaving mice to investigate the effects of the KE-family mutation on the function of striatal circuits during motor-skill learning. We uncovered abnormally high ongoing striatal activity in mice carrying an identical mutation to that of the KE family. Furthermore there were dramatic alterations in striatal plasticity during the acquisition of a motor skill with most neurons in mutants showing negative modulation of firing rate starkly contrasting with the predominantly positive modulation seen in control animals. We also observed striking changes in the temporal coordination of striatal firing during motor-skill learning in mutants.

We identified a Myo6(c.1381G>A) mutation that was found to be a p.E461K mutation leading to alternative splicing errors in Myo6 mRNA in ksv mutants.

Interestingly the expression of the stereociliary rootlet-specific TRIO and F-actin binding protein (TRIOBP) was altered in ksv/ksv mice. The abnormal expression of TRIOBP suggested that the rootlets in the hair cells of ksv/ksv mice had excessive growth.

Most known DS-causing mutations are in coding regions of SCN1A but we recently identified several disease-associated SCN1A mutations in intron 20 that are within or near to a cryptic and evolutionarily conserved ""poison"" exon 20N whose inclusion is predicted to lead to transcript degradation. However it is not clear how these intron 20 variants alter SCN1A expression or DS pathophysiology in an organismal context nor is it clear how exon 20N is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental context. We address those questions here by generating an animal model of our index case NM_006920.4(SCN1A):c.3969+2451G>C using gene editing to create the orthologous mutation in laboratory mice. Scn1a heterozygous knock-in (+/KI) mice exhibited an ~50% reduction in brain Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein levels together with characteristics observed in other DS mouse models including premature mortality seizures and hyperactivity. In brain tissue from adult Scn1a +/+ animals quantitative RT-PCR assays indicated that ~1% of Scn1a mRNA included exon 20N while brain tissue from Scn1a +/KI mice exhibited an ~5-fold increase in the extent of exon 20N inclusion. We investigated the extent of exon 20N inclusion in brain during normal fetal development in RNA-seq data and discovered that levels of inclusion were ~70% at E14.5 declining progressively to ~10% postnatally. A similar pattern exists for the homologous sodium channel Nav1.6 encoded by Scn8a. For both genes there is an inverse relationship between the level of functional transcript and the extent of poison exon inclusion. Taken together our findings suggest that poison exon usage by Scn1a and Scn8a is a strategy to regulate channel expression during normal brain development and that mutations recapitulating a fetal-like pattern of splicing cause reduced channel expression and epileptic encephalopathy.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099853193&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1009195&partnerID=40&md5=a058b96acbd3ccc97dc32a2bfa95b040","Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics Alzheimer's Disease Center and Evelyn F.

In the sensory cortex activity relayed by the thalamus during a postnatal sensitive period is essential for proper cortical maturation. Whether thalamic activity also shapes prefrontal cortical maturation is unknown. We show that inhibiting the mediodorsal and midline thalamus in mice during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in thalamo-prefrontal projection density and reduced excitatory drive to prefrontal neurons. It also caused prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits during adulthood associated with disrupted prefrontal cross-correlations and task outcome encoding. Thalamic inhibition during adulthood had no long-lasting consequences. Exciting the thalamus in adulthood during a cognitive task rescued prefrontal cross-correlations task outcome encoding and cognitive deficits. These data point to adolescence as a sensitive window of thalamocortical circuit maturation. Furthermore by supporting prefrontal network activity boosting thalamic activity provides a potential therapeutic strategy for rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130431597&doi=10.1038%2fs41593-022-01072-y&partnerID=40&md5=aba60917d83f4a71d035e145480ec2ae","Graduate Program in Neurobiology and Behavior Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Developmental Neuroscience New York State Psychiatric Institute New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Theoretical Neuroscience Columbia University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rZuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute Columbia University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKavli Institute for Brain Sciences Columbia University New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Systems Neuroscience New York State Psychiatric Institute New York NY USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY USA. ck491@cumc.columbia.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular Pharmacology & Therapeutics Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York NY USA. ck491@cumc.columbia.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Molecular Therapeutics New York State Psychiatric Institute New York NY USA. ck491@cumc.columbia.edu.",2022,"10.1038/s41593-022-01072-y","Article","AnimalsInhibition PsychologicalMiceNeural Pathways/physiologyNeurons/physiology*Prefrontal Cortex/physiology*SchizophreniaThalamus","pubmed-35590075.pdf","pubmed-35590075","xml_texts/PMC9202412.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41593-022-01072-y.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41593-022-01072-y.pdf"
"Wnd/DLK Is a Critical Target of FMRP Responsible for Neurodevelopmental and Behavior Defects in the Drosophila Model of Fragile X Syndrome","Russo A.DiAntonio A.","Cell Rep",NA,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and commonly co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder. Silencing of the Fmr1 gene leads to the absence of the protein product fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) which represses translation of many target mRNAs. Excess translation of these targets is one cause of neuronal dysfunction in FXS. Utilizing the Drosophila model of FXS we identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) Wallenda/dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) as a critical target of FMRP. dFMRP binds Wallenda mRNA and is required to limit Wallenda protein levels. In dFmr1 mutants Wallenda signaling drives defects in synaptic development neuronal morphology and behavior. Pharmacological inhibition of Wallenda in larvae suppresses dFmr1 neurodevelopmental phenotypes while adult administration prevents dFmr1 behavioral defects. We propose that in dFmr1 mutants chronic Wallenda/DLK signaling disrupts nervous system development and function and that inhibition of this kinase cascade might be a candidate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of FXS.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071291269&doi=10.1016%2fj.celrep.2019.08.001&partnerID=40&md5=b7fa8854427f38dc93dbfffc466f6110","Department of Developmental Biology Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis St. Louis MO 63110 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Developmental Biology Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis St. Louis MO 63110 USA; Needleman Center for Neurometabolism and Axonal Therapeutics Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis St. Louis MO 63110 USA.

There is association of both common functional alleles and rare copy number variants that impact levels of MET expression in the human cortex. The timing of Met expression is linked to axon terminal outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the developing rodent and primate forebrain and both in vitro and in vivo studies implicate this RTK in dendritic branching spine maturation and excitatory connectivity in the neocortex.

H.Peirson S. N.Flint J.Martin H. C.","Hum Mol Genet",NA,"The discovery of genetic variants influencing sleep patterns can shed light on the physiological processes underlying sleep. As part of a large clinical sequencing project WGS500 we sequenced a family in which the two male children had severe developmental delay and a dramatically disturbed sleep-wake cycle with very long wake and sleep durations reaching up to 106-h awake and 48-h asleep. The most likely causal variant identified was a novel missense variant in the X-linked GRIA3 gene which has been implicated in intellectual disability. GRIA3 encodes GluA3 a subunit of AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). The mutation (A653T) falls within the highly conserved transmembrane domain of the ion channel gate immediately adjacent to the analogous residue in the Grid2 (glutamate receptor) gene which is mutated in the mouse neurobehavioral mutant Lurcher. In vitro the GRIA3(A653T) mutation stabilizes the channel in a closed conformation in contrast to Lurcher. We introduced the orthologous mutation into a mouse strain by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis and found that hemizygous mutants displayed significant differences in the structure of their activity and sleep compared to wild-type littermates. Typically mice are polyphasic exhibiting multiple sleep bouts of sleep several minutes long within a 24-h period. The Gria3A653T mouse showed significantly fewer brief bouts of activity and sleep than the wild-types. Furthermore Gria3A653T mice showed enhanced period lengthening under constant light compared to wild-type mice suggesting an increased sensitivity to light.

Independent studies have indicated that 5-HT or drugs acting on 5-HT neurotransmission regulate the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Furthermore GSK3β inhibition rescues behavioural abnormalities in 5-HT-deficient mice with a loss-of-function mutation equivalent to the human variant (R441H) of tryptophan hydroxylase 2. In an effort to define neuroanatomical correlates of GSK3β activity in the regulation of behaviour we generated CamKIIcre-floxGSK3β mice in which the gsk3b gene is postnatally inactivated in forebrain pyramidal neurons. Behavioural characterization showed that suppression of GSK3β in these brain areas has anxiolytic and pro-social effects. However while a global reduction of GSK2β expression reduced responsiveness to amphetamine and increased resilience to social defeat these behavioural effects were not found in CamKIIcre-floxGSK3β mice. These findings demonstrate a dissociation of behavioural effects related to GSK3 inhibition with forebrain GSK3β being involved in the regulation of anxiety and sociability while social preference resilience and responsiveness to psychostimulants would involve a function of this kinase in subcortical areas such as the hippocampus and striatum.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864198258&doi=10.1098%2frstb.2012.0094&partnerID=40&md5=39f8347e18b49668b6bc9383d5d2e781","Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience Laval University  Quebec City Quebec Canada.",2012,"10.1098/rstb.2012.0094","Article","Amphetamine/pharmacologyAnimalsAnti-Anxiety Agents/metabolismAnxiety/metabolism/*physiopathologyEnzyme ActivationFemaleGene DeletionGene SilencingGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolismGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 betaMaleMiceMice Inbred C57BLMood Disorders/metabolism/physiopathologyMotor ActivityProsencephalon/drug effects/enzymology/*physiopathologySerotonin/genetics/*metabolism*Social BehaviorSwimming","pubmed-22826345.pdf","pubmed-22826345","xml_texts/PMC3405679.xml","full_texts/10.1098%2Frstb.2012.0094.txt","full_texts/10.1098%2Frstb.2012.0094.pdf"
"Topography and ensemble activity in auditory cortex of a mouse model of Fragile-X-Syndrome.","Wadle, SL; Ritter, TC; Wadle, TTX; Hirtz, JJ","eNeuro",NA,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with social communication impairments and specific sound processing deficits, for example problems in following speech in noisy environments. To investigate underlying neuronal processing defects located in the auditory neocortex (AC), we performed two-photon Ca 2+  imaging in  FMR1  ( Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein   1 ) knockout (KO) mice, a model for Fragile-X-Syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of hereditary ASD in humans. For primary AC (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF), topographic frequency representation was less ordered compared to control animals. We additionally analyzed ensemble AC activity in response to various sounds and found subfield-specific differences. In A1, ensemble correlations were lower in general, while in secondary AC (A2), correlations were higher in response to complex sounds, yet not to pure tones (PT). Furthermore, sound specificity of ensemble activity was decreased in AAF. Repeating these experiments one week later revealed no major differences regarding representational drift. Nevertheless, we found subfield- and genotype-specific changes in ensemble correlation values between the two times points, hinting at alterations in network stability in  FMR1  KO mice. These detailed insights into AC networks activity and topography in  FMR1  KO mice add to the understanding of auditory processing defects in FXS. Significance statement  Communicative challenges often observed in people with autism spectrum disorder might be due to defects in cortical brain circuits responsible for sound analysis. To investigate these in detail, we used a mouse model of Fragile-X-Syndrome, which often is associated with autism spectrum disorder in humans. We found several alterations compared to control animals, including a less well-ordered topography of frequency analysis in auditory cortex. Furthermore, neuronal population activity patterns in response to various sounds were altered. This was also highly dependent on whether pure tones or complex sounds were presented. These data help to understand the causes of sound processing defects in Fragile-X-Syndrome.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38627066",NA,2024,"10.1523/eneuro.0396-23.2024","Article",NA,"pubmed-38627066.pdf","pubmed-38627066","xml_texts/PMC11097631.xml","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0396-23.2024.txt","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0396-23.2024.pdf"

K.","Plos one",NA,"Cell-adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily play critical roles in brain development as well as in maintaining synaptic plasticity the dysfunction of which is known to cause cognitive impairment. Recently dysfunction of KIRREL3 a synaptic molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental conditions including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and in the neurocognitive delay associated with Jacobsen syndrome. However the molecular mechanisms of its physiological actions remain largely unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we found that the KIRREL3 extracellular domain interacts with brain expressed proteins MAP1B and MYO16 and its intracellular domain can potentially interact with ATP1B1 UFC1 and SHMT2. The interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses of proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney cells mouse neuronal cells and rat primary neuronal cells. Furthermore we show KIRREL3 colocalization with the marker for the Golgi apparatus and synaptic vesicles. Previously we have shown that KIRREL3 interacts with the X-linked intellectual disability associated synaptic scaffolding protein CASK through its cytoplasmic domain. In addition we found a genomic deletion encompassing MAP1B in one patient with intellectual disability microcephaly and seizures and deletions encompassing MYO16 in two unrelated patients with intellectual disability autism and microcephaly. MAP1B has been previously implicated in synaptogenesis and is involved in the development of the actin-based membrane skeleton. MYO16 is expressed in hippocampal neurons and also indirectly affects actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with WAVE1 complex. We speculate KIRREL3 interacting proteins are potential candidates for intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover our findings provide further insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological action of KIRREL3 and its role in neurodevelopment.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930624343&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0123106&partnerID=40&md5=2c1899ba5af58a69e3359b8b2b276f64","J.C.

In this study we generated brain-specific conditional cKO mouse mutants and assessed the impact of the Scrib deletion on brain morphogenesis and behavior.

DM presents in two forms DM1 and DM2 both of which are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions: CTG in the DMPK gene for DM1 and CCTG in ZNF9 (CNBP) for DM2. Previous studies have shown that the mutant mRNAs containing the transcribed CUG or CCUG repeats are retained within the nuclei of cells from individuals with DM where they bind and sequester the muscleblind-like proteins MBNL1 MBNL2 and MBNL3. It has been proposed that the sequestration of these proteins plays a key role in determining the classic features of DM. However the functions of each of the three MBNL genes are not completely understood. We have generated a zebrafish knockdown model in which we demonstrate that a lack of mbnl2 function causes morphological abnormalities at the eye heart brain and muscle levels supporting an essential role for mbnl2 during embryonic development. Major features of DM are replicated in our model including muscle defects and splicing abnormalities. We found that the absence of mbnl2 causes disruption to the organization of myofibrils in skeletal and heart muscle of zebrafish embryos and a reduction in the amount of both slow and fast muscle fibres. Notably our findings included altered splicing patterns of two transcripts whose expression is also altered in DM patients: clcn1 and tnnt2. The studies described herein provide broader insight into the functions of MBNL2. They also lend support to the hypothesis that the sequestration of this protein is an important determinant in DM pathophysiology and imply a direct role of MBNL2 in splicing regulation of specific transcripts which when altered contributes to the DM phenotype.",NA,NA,2011,"10.1242/dmm.004150","Article",NA,"pubmed-21303839.pdf","pubmed-21303839","xml_texts/PMC3097459.xml","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.004150.txt","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdmm.004150.pdf"

RNA-Seq comparing osteoblasts differentiated from Ezh2R684C/+, and Ezh2+/+ BM-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) indicated collective dysregulation of the BMP pathway and osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of the opposing H3K27 demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B substantially reversed the excessive osteogenesis in Ezh2R684C/+ cells both at the transcriptional and phenotypic levels.

"Effects of Soy-Based Infant Formula on Weight Gain and Neurodevelopment in an Autism Mouse Model","Westmark C. J.Filon M. J.Maina P.Steinberg L. I.Ikonomidou C.Westmark P. R.","Cells",NA,"Mice fed soy-based diets exhibit increased weight gain compared to mice fed casein-based diets and the effects are more pronounced in a model of fragile X syndrome (FXS; Fmr1(KO)). FXS is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by intellectual impairment seizures autistic behavior anxiety and obesity. Here we analyzed body weight as a function of mouse age diet and genotype to determine the effect of diet (soy casein and grain-based) on weight gain. We also assessed plasma protein biomarker expression and behavior in response to diet. Juvenile Fmr1(KO) mice fed a soy protein-based rodent chow throughout gestation and postnatal development exhibit increased weight gain compared to mice fed a casein-based purified ingredient diet or grain-based low phytoestrogen chow. Adolescent and adult Fmr1(KO) mice fed a soy-based infant formula diet exhibited increased weight gain compared to reference diets. Increased body mass was due to increased lean mass. Wild-type male mice fed soy-based infant formula exhibited increased learning in a passive avoidance paradigm and Fmr1(KO) male mice had a deficit in nest building. Thus at the systems level consumption of soy-based diets increases weight gain and affects behavior. At the molecular level a soy-based infant formula diet was associated with altered expression of numerous plasma proteins including the adipose hormone leptin and the β-amyloid degrading enzyme neprilysin. In conclusion single-source soy-based diets may contribute to the development of obesity and the exacerbation of neurological phenotypes in developmental disabilities such as FXS.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128209871&doi=10.3390%2fcells11081350&partnerID=40&md5=4d4a91008790c0d0dcd86f0ee45b14cc","Department of Neurology University of Wisconsin Madison WI 53706 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMolecular Environmental Toxicology Center University of Wisconsin Madison WI 53706 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rUndergraduate Research Program University of Wisconsin Madison WI 53706 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMolecular Environmental Toxicology Summer Research Opportunities Program University of Wisconsin Madison WI 53706 USA.",2022,"10.3390/cells11081350","Article","AdolescentAnimals*Autistic DisorderCaseins/metabolismDisease Models AnimalFragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/metabolism*Fragile X Syndrome/geneticsHumansInfant FormulaMaleMiceObesityWeight GainFmr1KOfragile Xsoy-based infant formula","pubmed-35456030.pdf","pubmed-35456030","xml_texts/PMC9025435.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fcells11081350.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fcells11081350.pdf"
"Analysis of genes within the schizophrenia-linked 22q11.2 deletion identifies interaction of night owl/LZTR1 and NF1 in GABAergic sleep control","Maurer G. W., Malita A., Nagy S., Koyama T., Werge T. M., Halberg K. A., Texada M. J., Rewitz K.","PLoS Genetics",NA,"The human 22q11.2 chromosomal deletion is one of the strongest identified genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Although the deletion spans a number of known genes the contribution of each of these to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is not known. To investigate the effect of individual genes within this interval on the pathophysiology associated with the deletion we analyzed their role in sleep a behavior affected in virtually all psychiatric disorders including the 22q11.2 DS. We identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl nowl) as a regulator of night-time sleep in Drosophila. In humans LZTR1 has been associated with Ras-dependent neurological diseases also caused by Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) deficiency. We show that Nf1 loss leads to a night-time sleep phenotype nearly identical to that of nowl loss and that nowl negatively regulates Ras and interacts with Nf1 in sleep regulation. Furthermore nowl is required for metabolic homeostasis suggesting that LZTR1 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to obesity associated with the 22q11.2 DS. Knockdown of nowl or Nf1 in GABA-responsive sleep-promoting neurons elicits the sleep phenotype and this defect can be rescued by increased GABA(A) receptor signaling indicating that Nowl regulates sleep through modulation of GABA signaling. Our results suggest that nowl/LZTR1 may be a conserved regulator of GABA signaling important for normal sleep that contributes to the 22q11.2 DS. Author summary Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder with a large genetic component to disease predisposition. One of the strongest genetic risk factors for this disorder is a relatively small genetic deletion of 43 genes on the 22(nd) chromosome called 22q11.2 which confers about a 25% risk of schizophrenia development. However it is likely that only some of these deleted genes affect disease risk so we tested most of them individually. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is disturbed sleep. Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved behavior that can be easily studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster so we investigated the effect on sleep of blocking expression of the fly homologs of most of the 22q11.2 genes and identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl nowl) as an important sleep regulator. We found that Nowl/LZTR1 is required for inhibition of the Ras pathway and interacts genetically with the Ras inhibitor NF1. Nowl/LZTR1 appears to function in sleep by modulating inhibitory GABA signaling which is affected in schizophrenia. Thus this gene may underlie some of the phenotypes of the human schizophrenia-risk deletion.",NA,NA,2020,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1008727","Article",NA,"wos-000531363700015.pdf","wos-000531363700015","xml_texts/PMC7205319.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008727.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008727.pdf"

A severe form of this disease with episodes combining ataxia epilepsy and hemiplegia was recently associated with a proline to arginine substitution at position 290 of the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in a heterozygous patient. The excitatory amino acid transporter 1 is the predominant glial glutamate transporter in the cerebellum. However this glutamate transporter also functions as an anion channel and earlier work in heterologous expression systems demonstrated that the mutation impairs the glutamate transport rate while increasing channel activity. To understand how these changes cause ataxia we developed a constitutive transgenic mouse model. Transgenic mice display epilepsy ataxia and cerebellar atrophy and thus closely resemble the human disease. We observed increased glutamate-activated chloride efflux in Bergmann glia that triggers the apoptosis of these cells during infancy. The loss of Bergmann glia results in reduced glutamate uptake and impaired neural network formation in the cerebellar cortex. This study shows how gain-of-function of glutamate transporter-associated anion channels causes ataxia through modifying cerebellar development.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089341490&doi=10.1093%2fbraincomms%2ffcaa022&partnerID=40&md5=341df5caef39bb61bce84a3c2b03c2b6","Institut für Biologische Informationsprozesse Molekular- und Zellphysiologie (IBI-1) Forschungszentrum Jülich 52428 Jülich Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAnatomisches Institut Anatomie und Zellbiologie Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelm Universität Bonn 53115 Bonn Germany.",2020,"10.1093/braincomms/fcaa022","Article","Bergmann gliachloride homeostasisepisodic ataxiaglial apoptosisglutamate transporters","pubmed-32954283.pdf","pubmed-32954283","xml_texts/PMC7425361.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa022.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa022.pdf"

The biological underpinnings of ASD are not well known but the hypothesis of serotonin (5-HT) involvement in the neurodevelopment of ASD is one of the longest standing. Reuptake through the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main pathway decreasing extracellular 5-HT in the brain and a marker for the 5-HT system but in vivo investigations of the 5-HTT and the 5-HT system in ASD are scarce and so far inconclusive. To quantify possible alterations in the 5-HT system in ASD we used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [(11)C]MADAM to measure 5-HTT availability in the brain of 15 adults with ASD and 15 controls. Moreover we examined correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and behavioral phenotype assessments regarding ASD core symptoms. In the ASD group we found significantly lower 5-HTT availability in total gray matter brainstem and 9 of 18 examined subregions of gray matter. In addition several correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and social cognitive test performance were found. The results confirm the hypothesis that 5-HTT availability is lower in the brain of adult individuals with ASD and are consistent with the theory of 5-HT involvement in ASD neurodevelopment. The findings endorse the central role of 5-HT in the physiology of ASD and confirm the need for a continued investigation of the 5-HT system in order to disentangle the biology of ASD.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089860235&doi=10.1038%2fs41380-020-00868-3&partnerID=40&md5=9b0ddcd12c9ac000ac886507f89d89bd","Department of Clinical Neuroscience Center for Psychiatry Research Karolinska Institutet and Region Stockholm Stockholm Sweden. max.andersson@ki.se.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Clinical Neuroscience Center for Psychiatry Research Karolinska Institutet and Region Stockholm Stockholm Sweden.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND) Center for Psychiatry Research Stockholm Health Care Services Region Stockholm Stockholm Sweden.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rChild and Adolescent Psychiatry Stockholm Health Care Services Region Stockholm Stockholm Sweden.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCurtin Autism Research Group School of Occupational Therapy Social Work and Speech Pathology Curtin University Perth WA Australia.",2021,"10.1038/s41380-020-00868-3","Article","Adult*Autism Spectrum Disorder/diagnostic imaging*Autistic Disorder/diagnostic imagingBrain/diagnostic imaging/metabolismHumansPositron-Emission TomographySerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism","pubmed-32848204.pdf","pubmed-32848204","xml_texts/PMC8159737.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-020-00868-3.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-020-00868-3.pdf"
"Neural Dynamics of Autistic Repetitive Behaviors and Fragile X Syndrome: Basal Ganglia Movement Gating and mGluR-Modulated Adaptively Timed Learning","Grossberg, S; Kishnan, D","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY",NA,"This article develops the iSTART neural model that proposes how specific imbalances in cognitive, emotional, timing, and motor processes that involve brain regions like prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum may interact together to cause behavioral symptoms of autism. These imbalances include underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala/hypothalamus, learning of hyperspecific recognition categories that help to cause narrowly focused attention in temporal and prefrontal cortices, and breakdowns of adaptively timed motivated attention and motor circuits in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The article expands the model's explanatory range by, first, explaining recent data about Fragile X syndrome (FXS), mGluR, and trace conditioning; and, second, by explaining distinct causes of stereotyped behaviors in individuals with autism. Some of these stereotyped behaviors, such as an insistence on sameness and circumscribed interests, may result from imbalances in the cognitive and emotional circuits that iSTART models. These behaviors may be ameliorated by operant conditioning methods. Other stereotyped behaviors, such as repetitive motor behaviors, may result from imbalances in how the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia open or close movement gates, respectively. These repetitive behaviors may be ameliorated by drugs that augment D2 dopamine receptor responses or reduce D1 dopamine receptor responses.

The present study uses an integrative genomics approach to explore mechanistic changes in early brain development in mouse embryos exposed to this maternal gene-environment phenomenon. Restraint stress was applied to pregnant Slc6a4 (+/+) and Slc6a4 (+/-) mice and post-stress embryonic brains were assessed for whole genome level profiling of methylome transcriptome and miRNA using Next Generation Sequencing. Embryos of stressed Slc6a4 (+/+) dams exhibited significantly altered methylation profiles and differential expression of 157 miRNAs and 1009 genes affecting neuron development and cellular adhesion pathways which may function as a coping mechanism to prenatal stress. In striking contrast the response of embryos of stressed Slc6a4 (+/-) dams was found to be attenuated shown by significantly reduced numbers of differentially expressed genes (458) and miRNA (0) and genome hypermethylation.

"Developmental effect of RASopathy mutations on neuronal network activity on a chip.","Weiss, EM; Guhathakurta, D; Petrušková, A; Hundrup, V; Zenker, M; Fejtová, A","Front Cell Neurosci",NA,"RASopathies are a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components and regulators of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, resulting in overactivation of signaling. RASopathy patients exhibit distinctive facial features, cardiopathies, growth and skeletal abnormalities, and varying degrees of neurocognitive impairments including neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disabilities, or attention deficits. At present, it is unclear how RASopathy mutations cause neurocognitive impairment and what their neuron-specific cellular and network phenotypes are. Here, we investigated the effect of RASopathy mutations on the establishment and functional maturation of neuronal networks. We isolated cortical neurons from RASopathy mouse models, cultured them on multielectrode arrays and performed longitudinal recordings of spontaneous activity in developing networks as well as recordings of evoked responses in mature neurons. To facilitate the analysis of large and complex data sets resulting from long-term multielectrode recordings, we developed MATLAB-based tools for data processing, analysis, and statistical evaluation. Longitudinal analysis of spontaneous network activity revealed a convergent developmental phenotype in neurons carrying the gain-of-function Noonan syndrome-related mutations  Ptpn11   D61Y  and  Kras   V14l . The phenotype was more pronounced at the earlier time points and faded out over time, suggesting the emergence of compensatory mechanisms during network maturation. Nevertheless, persistent differences in excitatory/inhibitory balance and network excitability were observed in mature networks.

"Muscle specific fragile X related protein 1 isoforms are sequestered in the nucleus of undifferentiated myoblast","Dubé M.Huot M. E.Khandjian E. W.","BMC Genet",NA,"BACKGROUND: The family of Fragile X Mental Retardation Proteins is composed of three members: Fragile Mental Retardation 1 Fragile X Related 1 and X Related 2 proteins. These proteins are associated with mRNPs within translating ribosomes and have the capacity to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Great attention has been given to FMRP due to its implication in human hereditary mental retardation while FXR1P and FXR2P have only recently been studied. RESULTS: Using antibodies directed against several epitopes of FXR1P we have detected protein isoforms generated by small peptides pocket inserts. Four isoforms of MW 70 74 78 80 kDa are widely distributed in mouse organs while in striated muscles these isoforms are replaced by proteins of 82 and 84 kDa containing an extra pocket of 27 aa. Expression of these muscle isoforms is an early event during in vitro differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes and correlates with the activation of muscle-specific genes. However while FXR1P8284 are associated with cytoplasmic mRNPs in myotubes they are sequestered in the nuclei of undifferentiated myoblasts. These observations suggest that in addition to a cytoplasmic function yet to be defined FXR1P8284 may play a nuclear role in pre-mRNA metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of subcellular partitioning of FXR1P isoforms during myogenesis is unique among the family of the FXR proteins. The model system described here should be considered as a powerful tool for ongoing attempts to unravel structure-function relationships of the different FMR family members since the potential role(s) of FXR1P as a compensatory factor in Fragile X syndrome is still elusive.",NA,"Unité de Recherche en Génétique Humaine et Moléculaire Hôpital Saint François d'Assise du CHUQ Québec Canada. miracle_marthe@hotmail.com",2000,"10.1186/1471-2156-1-4","Article","Amino Acid SequenceAnimalsAntibodies Monoclonal/biosynthesis/metabolismCell Differentiation/physiologyCell LineCell Nucleus/chemistryEpitopes/chemistry/immunologyFragile X Syndrome/metabolismImmunohistochemistryMiceMicroscopy FluorescenceMolecular Sequence DataMuscle DevelopmentMuscle Skeletal/cytology/*metabolismMyoblasts/chemistry/cytologyOrgan SpecificityPolyribosomes/chemistryProtein Isoforms/biosynthesis/immunology/metabolismRNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology/*metabolismRabbits","pubmed-11178106.pdf","pubmed-11178106","xml_texts/PMC29080.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2F1471-2156-1-4.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2F1471-2156-1-4.pdf"

Among environmental factors prenatal exposure to stress may increase the risk for ASD. To examine if there is an interaction between exposure to maternal stress and reduced dosage or loss of Shank3 wild-type (WT) heterozygous (HET) and homozygous (HOM) female mice carrying a deletion of exons four through nine of Shank3 (Shank3ex4-9) were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) from prior to conception throughout gestation. This study examined maternal care of these dams and the white matter microstructure in the brains of their adult male offspring. Overall our findings suggest that maternal exposure to CUMS increased pup-directed care for dams of all three genotypes. Compared to WT and HET dams HOM dams also exhibited increased maternal care behaviors with increased time spent in the nest and reduced cage exploration regardless of exposure to CUMS. Diffusion tensor imaging showed higher mean fractional anisotropy in the hippocampal stratum radiatum of WT and HOM male offspring from dams exposed to CUMS and HOM offspring from unexposed dams compared to WT male offspring from unexposed dams. These data support that CUMS in Shank3-mutant dams results in subtle maternal care alterations and long-lasting changes in the white matter of the hippocampus of their offspring.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074708257&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0224876&partnerID=40&md5=32cd1c6c3f1d96472cd2339e5a3179f8","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rJan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital Houston Texas United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular and Human Genetics Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pediatrics Section of Pediatrics Neurology and Developmental Neuroscience Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas United States of America.",2019,"10.1371/journal.pone.0224876","Article","AnimalsBehavior AnimalDiffusion Tensor ImagingFemaleHippocampus/metabolism/physiopathologyMaleMaternal Behavior*Maternal ExposureMiceMicrofilament ProteinsMutationNerve Tissue Proteins/*geneticsPregnancy*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects*Stress PsychologicalWhite Matter/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/*physiopathology","pubmed-31703095.pdf","pubmed-31703095","xml_texts/PMC6839842.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0224876.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0224876.pdf"

It is known that genetic and nongenetic factors determine alterations in several organs, such as the liver, in individuals with this disorder. The aims of the present study were to analyze morphological and biological alterations in the liver of an autistic mouse model, BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, and to identify therapeutic strategies for alleviating hepatic impairments using melatonin administration. We studied hepatic cytoarchitecture, oxidative stress, inflammation and ferroptosis in BTBR mice and used C57BL6/J mice as healthy control subjects. The mice were divided into four groups and then treated and not treated with melatonin, respectively. BTBR mice showed (a) a retarded development of livers and (b) iron accumulation and elevated oxidative stress and inflammation. We demonstrated that the expression of ferroptosis markers, the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NFR2), was upregulated, and the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) was downregulated in BTBR mice. Then, we evaluated the effects of melatonin on the hepatic alterations of BTBR mice; melatonin has a positive effect on liver cytoarchitecture and metabolic functions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38256159",NA,2024,"10.3390/ijms25021086","Article","autism spectrum disorder; ferroptosis; inflammation; liver; oxidative stress","pubmed-38256159.pdf","pubmed-38256159","xml_texts/PMC10816818.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms25021086.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms25021086.pdf"

Herein we develop a cross-correction-based strategy to enhance the efficiency of a gene therapy for CDKL5 deficiency disorder a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by CDKL5 gene mutations. We created a gene therapy vector that produces an Igk-TATk-CDKL5 fusion protein that can be secreted via constitutive secretory pathways and due to the cell-penetration property of the TATk peptide internalized by cells. We found that although AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 and AAVPHP.B_CDKL5 vectors had similar brain infection efficiency the AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 vector led to higher CDKL5 protein replacement due to secretion and penetration of the TATk-CDKL5 protein into the neighboring cells. Importantly Cdkl5 KO mice treated with the AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 vector showed a behavioral and neuroanatomical improvement in comparison with vehicle or AAVPHP.B_CDKL5 vector-treated Cdkl5 KO mice.

Although previous neurobiological studies on Shank3 and Shank3-mutant mice have revealed diverse roles of Shank3 in the regulation of synaptic neuronal and brain functions whether Shank3 expression in specific cell types distinctly contributes to mouse phenotypes remains largely unclear. In the present study we generated two Shank3-mutant mouse lines (exons 14-16) carrying global and GABA neuron-specific deletions and characterized their electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. These mouse lines show similar decreases in excitatory synaptic input onto dorsolateral striatal neurons. In addition the abnormal social and locomotor behaviors observed in global Shank3-mutant mice are strongly mimicked by GABA neuron-specific Shank3-mutant mice whereas the repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors are only partially mimicked. These results suggest that GABAergic Shank3 (exons 14-16) deletion has strong influences on striatal excitatory synaptic transmission and social and locomotor behaviors in mice.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054848738&doi=10.3389%2ffncel.2018.00341&partnerID=40&md5=52586bd0ae82a00456e252d347cfb255","Department of Biological Sciences Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST) Daejeon South Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions Institute for Basic Science (IBS) Daejeon South Korea.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Anatomy and Division of Brain Korea 21 Biomedical Science College of Medicie Korea University Seoul South Korea.",2018,"10.3389/fncel.2018.00341","Article","Phelan-McDermid syndromeShank3autismrepetitive behaviorsocial interactionstriatum","pubmed-30356810.pdf","pubmed-30356810","xml_texts/PMC6189516.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2018.00341.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffncel.2018.00341.pdf"

However, the efficacy of these treatments has been demonstrated mainly in animal models and has not been consistently predictive of targeted drugs' response in the preponderance of human clinical trials. Because of the heterogeneity of FXS at various levels, including the molecular level, phenotypic manifestation, and drug response, it is critically important to identify biomarkers that can help in patient stratification and prediction of therapeutic efficacy. The primary objective of this study was to assess the ability of molecular biomarkers to predict phenotypic subgroups, symptom severity, and treatment response to metformin in clinically treated patients with FXS. We specifically tested a triplex protein array comprising of hexokinase 1 (HK1), RAS (all isoforms), and Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) that we previously demonstrated were dysregulated in the FXS mouse model and in blood samples from patient with FXS. Seventeen participants with FXS, 12 males and 5 females, treated clinically with metformin were included in this study. The disruption in expression abundance of these proteins was normalized and associated with significant self-reported improvement in clinical phenotypes (CGI-I in addition to BMI) in a subset of participants with FXS.

Herein, we leveraged an unbiased proteomic approach to demonstrate that male, but not female, heterozygous Nf1 ± microglia exhibit differences in protein expression, which largely reflect pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization. In keeping with these predicted defects in cytoskeletal function, only male Nf1 ± microglia had reduced process arborization and surveillance capacity. To determine whether these microglial defects were cell autonomous or reflected adaptive responses to Nf1 heterozygosity in other cells in the brain, we generated conditional microglia Nf1-mutant knockout mice by intercrossing Nf1 flox/flox  with Cx3cr1-Cre ER  mice (Nf1 flox/wt ; Cx3cr1-Cre ER  mice, Nf1 MG  ± mice). Surprisingly, neither male nor female Nf1 MG  ± mouse microglia had impaired process arborization or surveillance capacity. In contrast, when Nf1 heterozygosity was generated in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by intercrossing Nf1 flox/flox  with hGFAP-Cre mice (Nf1 flox/wt ; hGFAP-Cre mice, Nf1 GFAP  ± mice), the microglia defects found in Nf1 ± mice were recapitulated.

Trim28 mutants additionally develop metabolic syndrome and abnormal behavior with incomplete penetrance. Genome-wide gene expression analyses identified 284 significantly dysregulated genes in Trim28 heterozygote mutants compared to wild-type mice with Mas1 which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor implicated in lipid metabolism showing the greatest average change in expression (7.8-fold higher in mutants). This gene also showed highly variable expression between mutant individuals.

The overexpression of genes encoded by the extra copy of a normal chromosome in DS is believed to be sufficient to perturb normal pathways and normal responses to stimulation causing learning and memory deficits. In this work we have designed a strategy based on the unsupervised clustering method Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to identify biologically important differences in protein levels in mice exposed to context fear conditioning (CFC). We analyzed expression levels of 77 proteins obtained from normal genotype control mice and from their trisomic littermates (Ts65Dn) both with and without treatment with the drug memantine. Control mice learn successfully while the trisomic mice fail unless they are first treated with the drug which rescues their learning ability. The SOM approach identified reduced subsets of proteins predicted to make the most critical contributions to normal learning to failed learning and rescued learning and provides a visual representation of the data that allows the user to extract patterns that may underlie novel biological responses to the different kinds of learning and the response to memantine. Results suggest that the application of SOM to new experimental data sets of complex protein profiles can be used to identify common critical protein responses which in turn may aid in identifying potentially more effective drug targets.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938367409&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0129126&partnerID=40&md5=4c8a1007862bb6e68f57ecc58eb9b30f","Departamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular I Facultad de Ciencias Químicas Universidad Complutense Madrid Spain; Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial e Ingeniería del Software Facultad de Informática Universidad Complutense Madrid Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLinda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome Department of Pediatrics Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Human Medical Genetics and Genomics and Neuroscience Programs University of Colorado School of Medicine Aurora Colorado United States of America.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Computer Science Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond Virginia United States of America; IITiS Polish Academy of Sciences Gliwice Poland.",2015,"10.1371/journal.pone.0129126","Article","AnimalsCluster AnalysisDisease Models AnimalDown Syndrome/drug therapy/*metabolismGene Expression Regulation/drug effectsHumans*Learning/drug effectsMemantine/*pharmacology/therapeutic useMemory Disorders/drug therapy/metabolismMice*Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects","pubmed-26111164.pdf","pubmed-26111164","xml_texts/PMC4482027.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0129126.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0129126.pdf"

"Delayed Recovery of Skeletal Muscle Mass following Hindlimb Immobilization in mTOR Heterozygous Mice","Lang S. M., Kazi A. A., Hong-Brown L., Lang C. H.","PLoS One",NA,"The present study addressed the hypothesis that reducing mTOR as seen in mTOR heterozygous (+/-) mice would exaggerate the changes in protein synthesis and degradation observed during hindlimb immobilization as well as impair normal muscle regrowth during the recovery period. Atrophy was produced by unilateral hindlimb immobilization and data compared to the contralateral gastrocnemius. In wild-type (WT) mice the gradual loss of muscle mass plateaued by day 7. This response was associated with a reduction in basal protein synthesis and development of leucine resistance. Proteasome activity was consistently elevated but atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNAs were only transiently increased returning to basal values by day 7. When assessed 7 days after immobilization the decreased muscle mass and protein synthesis and increased proteasome activity did not differ between WT and mTOR(+/-) mice. Moreover the muscle inflammatory cytokine response did not differ between groups. After 10 days of recovery WT mice showed no decrement in muscle mass and this accretion resulted from a sustained increase in protein synthesis and a normalization of proteasome activity. In contrast mTOR(+/-) mice failed to fully replete muscle mass at this time a defect caused by the lack of a compensatory increase in protein synthesis. The delayed muscle regrowth of the previously immobilized muscle in the mTOR(+/-) mice was associated with a decreased raptor.4EBP1 and increased raptor.Deptor binding. Slowed regrowth was also associated with a sustained inflammatory response (e. g. increased TNF alpha and CD45 mRNA) during the recovery period and a failure of IGF-I to increase as in WT mice. These data suggest mTOR is relatively more important in regulating the accretion of muscle mass during recovery than the loss of muscle during the atrophy phase and that protein synthesis is more sensitive than degradation to the reduction in mTOR during muscle regrowth.",NA,NA,2012,"10.1371/journal.pone.0038910","Article",NA,"wos-000305730900023.pdf","wos-000305730900023","xml_texts/PMC3382153.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038910.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038910.pdf"
"Parallel learning and cognitive flexibility impairments between Fmr1 knockout mice and individuals with fragile X syndrome.","Schmitt, LM; Arzuaga, AL; Dapore, A; Duncan, J; Patel, M; Larson, JR; Erickson, CA; Sweeney, JA; Ragozzino, ME","Front Behav Neurosci",NA,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic condition that leads to intellectual disability along with behavioral and learning difficulties. Among behavioral and learning difficulties, cognitive flexibility impairments are among the most commonly reported in FXS, which significantly impacts daily living. Despite the extensive use of the  Fmr1  knockout (KO) mouse to understand molecular, synaptic and behavioral alterations related to FXS, there has been limited development of translational paradigms to understand cognitive flexibility that can be employed in both animal models and individuals with FXS to facilitate treatment development. To begin addressing this limitation, a parallel set of studies were carried out that investigated probabilistic reversal learning along with other behavioral and cognitive tests in individuals with FXS and  Fmr1  KO mice. Fifty-five adolescents and adults with FXS (67% male) and 34 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (62% male) completed an initial probabilistic learning training task and a probabilistic reversal learning task. In males with FXS, both initial probabilistic learning and reversal learning deficits were found. However, in females with FXS, we only observed reversal learning deficits. Reversal learning deficits related to more severe psychiatric features in females with FXS, whereas increased sensitivity to negative feedback (lose:shift errors) unexpectedly appear to be adaptive in males with FXS. Male  Fmr1  KO mice exhibited both an initial probabilistic learning and reversal learning deficit compared to that of wildtype (WT) mice. Female  Fmr1  KO mice were selectively impaired on probabilistic reversal learning. In a prepotent response inhibition test, both male and female  Fmr1  KO mice were impaired in learning to choose a non-preferred spatial location to receive a food reward compared to that of WT mice. Neither male nor female  Fmr1  KO mice exhibited a change in anxiety compared to that of WT mice. Together, our findings demonstrate strikingly similar sex-dependent learning disturbances across individuals with FXS and  Fmr1  KO mice. This suggests the promise of using analogous paradigms of cognitive flexibility across species that may speed treatment development to improve lives of individuals with FXS.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36688132","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Cincinnati College of Medicine",2023,"10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1074682","Article","FMR1; autism; cognitive flexibility; executive function; fragile X syndrome","pubmed-36688132.pdf","pubmed-36688132","xml_texts/PMC9849779.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2022.1074682.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2022.1074682.pdf"

L.Muscatelli F.","Mol Psychiatry",NA,"Oxytocin is an important regulator of the social brain. In some animal models of autism notably in Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient mice peripheral administration of oxytocin in infancy improves social behaviors until adulthood. However neither the mechanisms responsible for social deficits nor the mechanisms by which such oxytocin administration has long-term effects are known. Here we aimed to clarify these oxytocin-dependent mechanisms focusing on social memory performance. Using in situ hybridization (RNAscope) we have established that Magel2 and oxytocin receptor are co-expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA2/CA3 hippocampal regions involved in the circuitry underlying social memory. Then we have shown that Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient mice evaluated in a three-chamber test present a deficit in social memory. Next in hippocampus we conducted neuroanatomical and functional studies using immunostaining oxytocin-binding experiments ex vivo electrophysiological recordings calcium imaging and biochemical studies. We demonstrated: an increase of the GABAergic activity of CA3-pyramidal cells associated with an increase in the quantity of oxytocin receptors and of somatostatin interneurons in both DG and CA2/CA3 regions. We also revealed a delay in the GABAergic development sequence in Magel2(tm1.1Mus)-deficient pups linked to phosphorylation modifications of KCC2. Above all we demonstrated the positive effects of subcutaneous administration of oxytocin in the mutant neonates restoring hippocampal alterations and social memory at adulthood. Although clinical trials are debated this study highlights the mechanisms by which peripheral oxytocin administration in neonates impacts the brain and demonstrates the therapeutic value of oxytocin to treat infants with autism spectrum disorders.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110975944&doi=10.1038%2fs41380-021-01227-6&partnerID=40&md5=f688d914e1c787f73753e383ec4a46a9","Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) UMR 1249 Institut de Neurobiologie de la Méditerranée (INMED) Institut Marseille Maladies Rares (MarMaRa) Aix-Marseille Université Marseille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPhenotype-expertise Marseille France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute of Neuroscience National Research Council (CNR) Vedano al Lambro Italy.

Here using in vivo mouse genetics we show that increasing UBE3A in the nucleus downregulates the glutamatergic synapse organizer Cbln1 which is needed for sociability in mice. Epileptic seizures also repress Cbln1 and are found to expose sociability impairments in mice with asymptomatic increases in UBE3A. This Ube3a-seizure synergy maps to glutamate neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) where Cbln1 deletions impair sociability and weaken glutamatergic transmission. We provide preclinical evidence that viral-vector-based chemogenetic activation of or restoration of Cbln1 in VTA glutamatergic neurons reverses the sociability deficits induced by Ube3a and/or seizures.

"Resveratrol Mitigates Sevoflurane-Induced Neurotoxicity by the SIRT1-Dependent Regulation of BDNF Expression in Developing Mice","Tang X., Zhao Y., Zhou Z., Yan J., Zhou B., Chi X., Luo A., Li S.","Oxid Med Cell Longev",NA,"Various lines of evidence suggest that neonatal exposure to general anesthetics especially repeatedly results in neuropathological brain changes and long-term cognitive impairment. Although progress has been made in experimental models the exact mechanism of GA-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain remains to be clarified. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance and its abnormal reduction is associated with cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. However the role of SIRT1 in GA-induced neurotoxicity is unclear to date. In this study we found that the protein level of SIRT1 was inhibited in the hippocampi of developing mice exposed to sevoflurane. Furthermore the SIRT1 inhibition in hippocampi was associated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) downregulation modulated by methyl-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Pretreatment of neonatal mice with resveratrol nearly reversed the reduction in hippocampal SIRT1 expression which increased the expression of BDNF in developing mice exposed to sevoflurane. Moreover changes in the levels of CREB and MeCP2 which were considered to interact with BDNF promoter IV were also rescued by resveratrol. Furthermore resveratrol improved the cognitive performance in the Morris water maze test of the adult mice with exposure to sevoflurane in the neonatal stage without changing motor function in the open field test. Taken together our findings suggested that SIRT1 deficiency regulated BDNF signaling via regulation of the epigenetic activity of MeCP2 and CREB and resveratrol might be a promising agent for mitigating sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in developing mice.",NA,NA,2020,"10.1155/2020/9018624","Article",NA,"pubmed-32148659.pdf","pubmed-32148659","xml_texts/PMC7049870.xml","full_texts/10.1155%2F2020%2F9018624.txt","full_texts/10.1155%2F2020%2F9018624.pdf"

The neuromotor development of B6.129-Shank3(tm2Gfng/J) (Shank3B(-/-)) mice as an animal model of autism has not been analyzed yet. The aim of this study was to compare the early neuromotor development of Shank3B(-/-) to wild-type mice. The mice underwent a multitude of neurodevelopmental tests and observations from postnatal day 1 (PND = 1) to weaning. Shank3B(-/-) mice opened their eyes later than their wild-type litter mates (p &lt; 0.01). Shank3B(-/-) mice were also slower in the negative geotaxis test from PND = 13 to PND = 16 (p &lt; 0.001) in both sexes. The results of this study indicate neurodevelopmental deficits in Shank3B(-/-) mice. The test is partially dependent on truncal motor control and these lines of evidence suggest a phenotype of developmental hypotonia which corresponds with the phenotypes seen in patients with Phelan-McDermid Syndrome. There was no observable effect of sex in any of the tests. There were no observed differences in upper and lower incisor eruption ear unfolding air righting surface righting and ear twitch reflexes.

"Contributions of Ca(V)1.3 Channels to Ca(2+) Current and Ca(2+)-Activated BK Current in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus","McNally B. A.Plante A. E.Meredith A. L.","Front Physiol",NA,"Daily regulation of Ca(2+) - and voltage-activated BK K(+) channel activity is required for action potential rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus the brain's circadian clock. In SCN neurons BK activation is dependent upon multiple types of Ca(2+) channels in a circadian manner. Daytime BK current predominantly requires Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCCs) a time when BK channels are closely coupled with their Ca(2+) source. Here we show that daytime BK current is resistant to the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA. However at night when LTCCs contribute little to BK activation BK current decreases by a third in BAPTA compared to control EGTA conditions. In phase with this time-of-day specific effect on BK current activation LTCC current is larger during the day. The specific Ca(2+) channel subtypes underlying the LTCC current in SCN as well as the subtypes contributing the Ca(2+) influx relevant for BK current activation have not been identified. SCN neurons express two LTCC subtypes Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)1.3. While a role for Ca(V)1.2 channels has been identified during the night Ca(V)1.3 channel modulation has also been suggested to contribute to daytime SCN action potential activity as well as subthreshold Ca(2+) oscillations. Here we characterize the role of Ca(V)1.3 channels in LTCC and BK current activation in SCN neurons using a global deletion of CACNA1D in mouse (Ca(V)1.3 KO). Ca(V)1.3 KO SCN neurons had a 50% reduction in the daytime LTCC current but not total Ca(2+) current with no difference in Ca(2+) current levels at night. During the day Ca(V)1.3 KO neurons exhibited oscillations in membrane potential and most neurons although not all also had BK currents. Changes in BK current activation were only detectable at the highest voltage tested. These data show that while Ca(V)1.3 channels contribute to the daytime Ca(2+) current this does not translate into a major effect on the daytime BK current. These data suggest that BK current activation does not absolutely require Ca(V)1.3 channels and may therefore also depend on other LTCC subtypes such as Ca(V)1.2.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116936649&doi=10.3389%2ffphys.2021.737291&partnerID=40&md5=81dceefce2df11b60bf27315da5441e5","Department of Physiology University of Maryland School of Medicine Baltimore MD United States.",2021,"10.3389/fphys.2021.737291","Article","BK channelCacna1dCa2+-activated K+ channelKcnma1L-type Ca2+ channelcircadian rhythm","pubmed-34650447.pdf","pubmed-34650447","xml_texts/PMC8505962.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffphys.2021.737291.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffphys.2021.737291.pdf"

R.","Physiol Rep",NA,"Big conductance potassium (BK) channels contribute to K(+) flow and electrical behavior in many cell types. Mice made null for the gene (Kcnma1) producing the BK channel (BK(KO)) exhibit numerous deficits in physiological functions. Breeding mice lacking a single allele of Kcnma1 (C57BL/6J background) had litter sizes of approximately eight pups. For the period of maternal care (P0-P21) pup deaths peaked at P1 with a second less severe interval of death peaking near P13. Early deaths were twice as likely during a 20-month period of building construction compared with the quiescent period after cessation of construction. Births during construction were not consistent with Mendelian predictions indicating the likelihood of a specific disadvantage induced by this environmental stressor. Later BK(KO) pup deaths (~P13) also were more numerous than Mendelian expectations. After weaning weight gain was slower for BK(KO) mice compared with wild-type littermates: 5 g less for male BK(KO) mice and 4 g less for female BK(KO) mice. Body composition determined by quantitative magnetic resonance indicated a higher fat proportion for wild-type female mice compared with males as well as a higher hydration ratio. Both male and female BK(KO) mice showed higher fat proportions than wild-type with female BK(KO) mice exhibiting greater variation. Together these results indicate that BK(KO) mice suffered disadvantages that lead to prenatal and perinatal death. A metabolic difference likely related to glucose handling led to the smaller body size and distinct composition for BK(KO) mice suggesting a diversion of energy supplies from growth to fat storage.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014107033&doi=10.14814%2fphy2.13137&partnerID=40&md5=4d9d4dc4571833842f05ec4b4dab3a12","Department of Neuroscience Cell Biology and Physiology Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine Dayton Ohio.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics Statistical Consulting Center Wright State University Dayton Ohio.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine Dayton Ohio.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience Cell Biology and Physiology Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine Dayton Ohio dan.halm@wright.edu.",2017,"10.14814/phy2.13137","Article","Adipose Tissue/*metabolismAnimalsBody Composition/*geneticsBody Weight/*geneticsLarge-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel alphaSubunits/genetics/*metabolismMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutBody compositionbreeding successenvironmental stressglucose tolerancemouse developmentquantitative magnetic resonance","pubmed-28242822.pdf","pubmed-28242822","xml_texts/PMC5328773.xml","full_texts/10.14814%2Fphy2.13137.txt","full_texts/10.14814%2Fphy2.13137.pdf"
"Neurexin1⍺ differentially regulates synaptic efficacy within striatal circuits","Davatolhagh M.F., Fuccillo M.V.","Cell Reports",NA,"Mutations in genes essential for synaptic function, such as the presynaptic adhesion molecule Neurexin1α (Nrxn1α), are strongly implicated in neuropsychiatric pathophysiology. As the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, the striatum integrates diverse excitatory projections governing cognitive and motor control, and its impairment may represent a recurrent pathway to disease. Here, we test the functional relevance of Nrxn1α in striatal circuits by employing optogenetic-mediated afferent recruitment of dorsal prefrontal cortical (dPFC) and parafascicular thalamic connections onto dorsomedial striatal (DMS) spiny projection neurons (SPNs). For dPFC-DMS circuits, we find decreased synaptic strength specifically onto indirect pathway SPNs in both Nrxn1α+/− and Nrxn1α−/− mice, driven by reductions in neurotransmitter release. In contrast, thalamic excitatory inputs to DMS exhibit relatively normal excitatory synaptic strength despite changes in synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) content. These findings suggest that dysregulation of Nrxn1α modulates striatal function in an input- and target-specific manner. Davatolhagh and Fuccillo demonstrate that loss of Nrxn1α, a synaptic cell adhesion molecule, leads to divergent synaptic phenotypes within dorsal medial striatum for inputs from dorsal prefrontal cortex and parafascicular thalamic nucleus. These findings suggest input-specific imbalances in striatal circuit activity as a key perturbation in models of neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2021 The Author(s)","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101391916&doi=10.1016%2fj.celrep.2021.108773&partnerID=40&md5=b8983508f0e958e31526d8dc7a96ae76","Neuroscience Graduate Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States; Department of Neuroscience, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA  19104, United States",2021,"10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108773","Article","n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; neurexin; neurexin 1 alpha; neurotransmitter; unclassified drug; calcium binding protein; glutamic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; nerve cell adhesion molecule; Nrxn1 protein, mouse; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain electrophysiology; controlled study; corpus striatum; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dorsomedial striatum; female; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; infant; intracellular recording; male; medium spiny neuron; microscopy; mouse; neurotransmitter release; newborn; nonhuman; optogenetics; protein function; synaptic efficacy; thalamus parafascicular nucleus; animal; C57BL mouse; corpus striatum; cytology; electrical synapse; excitatory postsynaptic potential; genetics; heterozygote; homozygote; knockout mouse; metabolism; mutation; sensory nerve; synaptic transmission; Afferent Pathways; Animals; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Corpus Striatum; Electrical Synapses; Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; Glutamic Acid; Heterozygote; Homozygote; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; Optogenetics; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Synaptic Transmission","scopus-85101391916.pdf","scopus-85101391916","xml_texts/PMC8071350.xml","full_texts/10.1016%2Fj.celrep.2021.108773.txt","full_texts/10.1016%2Fj.celrep.2021.108773.pdf"

Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and gut microbiota dysbiosis are frequently associated with ASD in childhood. However it is not known whether microbiota dysbiosis in ASD patients also occurs in adulthood. Further the consequences of altered gut microbiota on digestive functions and the enteric nervous system (ENS) remain unexplored. Therefore we studied in mice the ability offecal supernatant (FS) from adult ASD patients to induce GI dysfunctions and ENS remodeling. First the analyses of the fecal microbiota composition in adult ASD patients indicated a reduced α-diversity and increased abundance of three bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants compared to healthy controls (HC). The transfer of FS from ASD patients (FS-ASD) to mice decreased colonic barrier permeability by 29% and 58% compared to FS-HC for paracellular and transcellular permeability respectively. These effects are associated with the reduced expression of the tight junction proteins JAM-A ZO-2 cingulin and proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL1β. In addition the expression of glial and neuronal molecules was reduced by FS-ASD as compared to FS-HC in particular for those involved in neuronal connectivity (βIII-tubulin and synapsin decreased by 31% and 67% respectively). Our data suggest that changes in microbiota composition in ASD may contribute to GI alterations and in part via ENS remodeling.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112358038&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms9081723&partnerID=40&md5=7d610d156a8b93996fb76f06ad4a5977","Inserm TENS The Enteric Nervous System in Gut and Brain Disorders IMAD Université deNantes 44035 Nantes France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Université d'Angers 44045 Angers France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire 06560 Valbonne France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Life Science Université Côte d'Azur 06103 Nice France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rFondation FondaMental 94000 Créteil France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rINSERM U955 Neuro-Psychiatrie Translationnelle Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomédicale 94010 Créteil France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAP-HP Département médico-Universitaire d'Addictologie et de Psychiatrie des Hôpitaux Henri Mondor Université Paris Est Créteil 94010 Créteil France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rBioFortis Mérieux NutriSciences 44800 Saint-Herblain France.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCNRS UMR 6004 Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N) Université de Nantes 44000 Nantes France.",2021,"10.3390/microorganisms9081723","Article","autismbacterial metaboliteenteric nervous systemintestinal permeabilitymicrobiota","pubmed-34442802.pdf","pubmed-34442802","xml_texts/PMC8399841.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fmicroorganisms9081723.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fmicroorganisms9081723.pdf"
"Alterations in Cerebellar Microtubule Cytoskeletal Network in a ValproicAcid-Induced Rat Model of Autism Spectrum Disorders.","Gąssowska-Dobrowolska, M; Kolasa, A; Beversdorf, DQ; Adamczyk, A","Biomedicines",NA,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental diseases characterised by deficits in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviours. The growing body of evidence points to a role for cerebellar changes in ASD pathology. Some of the findings suggest that not only motor problems but also social deficits, repetitive behaviours, and mental inflexibility associated with ASD are connected with damage to the cerebellum. However, the understanding of this brain structure's functions in ASD pathology needs future investigations. Therefore, in this study, we generated a rodent model of ASD through a single prenatal administration of valproic acid (VPA) into pregnant rats, followed by cerebellar morphological studies of the offspring, focusing on the alterations of key cytoskeletal elements. The expression (Western blot) of α/β-tubulin and the major neuronal MT-associated proteins (MAP) such as MAP-Tau and MAP1B, MAP2, MAP6 (STOP) along with actin-crosslinking αII-spectrin and neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L) was investigated. We found that maternal exposure to VPA induces a significant decrease in the protein levels of α/β-tubulin, MAP-Tau, MAP1B, MAP2, and αII-spectrin. Moreover, excessive MAP-Tau phosphorylation at (Ser396) along with key Tau-kinases activation was indicated. Immunohistochemical staining showed chromatolysis in the cerebellum of autistic-like rats and loss of Purkinje cells shedding light on one of the possible molecular mechanisms underpinning neuroplasticity alterations in the ASD brain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36551785","Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin|Polish Academy of Sciences|University of Missouri",2022,"10.3390/biomedicines10123031","Article","MAP-Tau; MAP1B; MAP2; MAP6 (STOP); Tau-kinases; autism spectrum disorders (ASD); cerebellum; valproic acid (VPA); α/β-tubulin; αII-spectrin","pubmed-36551785.pdf","pubmed-36551785","xml_texts/PMC9776106.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fbiomedicines10123031.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fbiomedicines10123031.pdf"

Some variants fit into a framework wherein gain-of-function missense variants that increase neuronal excitability lead to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, while loss-of-function variants that reduce neuronal excitability lead to intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without co-morbid seizures. One unique case less easily classified using this framework is the de novo missense variant SCN2A-p.K1422E, associated with infant-onset developmental delay, infantile spasms and features of ASD. Prior structure-function studies demonstrated that K1422E substitution alters ion selectivity of NaV1.2, conferring Ca2+ permeability, lowering overall conductance and conferring resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on heterologous expression of K1422E, we developed a compartmental neuron model incorporating variant channels that predicted reductions in peak action potential (AP) speed. We generated Scn2aK1422E mice and characterized effects on neurons and neurological/neurobehavioral phenotypes. Cultured cortical neurons from heterozygous Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited lower current density with a TTX-resistant component and reversal potential consistent with mixed ion permeation. Recordings from Scn2aK1442E/+ cortical slices demonstrated impaired AP initiation and larger Ca2+ transients at the axon initial segment during the rising phase of the AP, suggesting complex effects on channel function. Scn2aK1422E/+ mice exhibited rare spontaneous seizures, interictal electroencephalogram abnormalities, altered induced seizure thresholds, reduced anxiety-like behavior and alterations in olfactory-guided social behavior. Overall, Scn2aK1422E/+ mice present with phenotypes similar yet distinct from other Scn2a models, consistent with complex effects of K1422E on NaV1.2 channel function. © The Author(s) 2022.

A heterozygous missense mutation in the KE family causes speech apraxia involving difficulty producing words with complex learned sequences of syllables. Manipulations in songbirds have helped to elucidate the role of this gene in vocal learning but findings in non-human mammals have been limited or inconclusive. Here we performed a systematic study of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male mice carrying the KE family mutation. Using novel statistical tools we found that Foxp2 heterozygous mice did not have detectable changes in USV syllable acoustic structure but produced shorter sequences and did not shift to more complex syntax in social contexts where wildtype animals did. Heterozygous mice also displayed a shift in the position of their rudimentary laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) layer-5 neurons.

Striatal dysfunction has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders raising the question of whether there are sex differences in how the striatum is impacted by genetic risk factors linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we report male-specific deficits in striatal function important to reward learning in a mouse model of 16p11.2 hemideletion a genetic mutation that is strongly associated with the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders particularly autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We find that male but not female 16p11.2 deletion animals show impairments in reward-directed learning and maintaining motivation to work for rewards. Male but not female deletion animals overexpress mRNA for dopamine receptor 2 and adenosine receptor 2a in the striatum markers of medium spiny neurons signaling via the indirect pathway associated with behavioral inhibition. Both sexes show a 50% reduction of mRNA levels of the genes located within the 16p11.2 region in the striatum including the kinase extracellular-signal related kinase 1 (ERK1). However hemideletion males show increased activation in the striatum for ERK1 both at baseline and in response to sucrose a signaling change associated with decreased striatal plasticity. This increase in ERK1 phosphorylation is coupled with a decrease in the abundance of the ERK phosphatase striatum-enriched protein-tyrosine phosphatase in hemideletion males. In contrast females do not show activation of ERK1 in response to sucrose but notably hemideletion females show elevated protein levels for ERK1 as well as the related kinase ERK2 over what would be predicted by mRNA levels. These data indicate profound sex differences in the impact of a genetic lesion linked with neurodevelopmental disorders including mechanisms of male-specific vulnerability and female-specific resilience impacting intracellular signaling in the brain.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037987123&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2017.184&partnerID=40&md5=9f71fa87d25fd20bc0ea24ceb0f3fe64","Department of Pharmacology University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rSchool of Biological Sciences Washington State University Vancouver Vancouver WA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Anesthesia Boston Children's Hospital Harvard Medical School Boston MA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics RWTH Aachen University Aachen Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rJülich Aachen Research Alliance-Translational Brain Medicine Aachen Germany.",2018,"10.1038/mp.2017.184","Article","AnimalsAutism Spectrum Disorder/metabolismAutistic Disorder/geneticsChromosome DeletionCorpus Striatum/*metabolismDisease Models AnimalExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolismFemaleLearning/*physiologyMAP Kinase Signaling System/geneticsMaleMiceMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/geneticsMotivation/geneticsNeurodevelopmental Disorders/*genetics/metabolismPhosphorylationRewardSex FactorsSignal Transduction/genetics","pubmed-29038598.pdf","pubmed-29038598","xml_texts/PMC5822461.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fmp.2017.184.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fmp.2017.184.pdf"

We investigated the role of the Drosophila OPHN1 ortholog Graf in the development of the mushroom body (MB) a key brain structure for learning and memory in insects. We show that loss of Graf causes abnormal crossing of the MB β lobe over the brain midline during metamorphosis. This defect in Graf mutants is rescued by MB-specific expression of Graf and OPHN1. Furthermore MB α/β neuron-specific RNA interference experiments and mosaic analyses indicate that Graf acts via a cell-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with the negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by Graf activation of this pathway is required for the β-lobe midline-crossing phenotype of Graf mutants.

The 16p11.2 duplication is a copy number variant that confers risk for diverse NPDs including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual disability and epilepsy. We used a mouse model of the 16p11.2 duplication (16p11.2 dup/+ ) to uncover molecular and circuit properties associated with this broad phenotypic spectrum, and examined genes within the locus capable of phenotype reversal. Quantitative proteomics revealed alterations to synaptic networks and products of NPD risk genes. We identified an epilepsy-associated subnetwork that was dysregulated in 16p11.2 dup/+  mice and altered in brain tissue from individuals with NPDs. Cortical circuits from 16p11.2 dup/+  mice exhibited hypersynchronous activity and enhanced network glutamate release, which increased susceptibility to seizures. Using gene co-expression and interactome analysis, we show that PRRT2 is a major hub in the epilepsy subnetwork. Remarkably, correcting Prrt2 copy number rescued aberrant circuit properties, seizure susceptibility and social deficits in 16p11.2 dup/+  mice.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex contribute to these responses and are generally thought to activate transcription. However the mechanisms keeping such ""early activation"" genes silent have been a mystery. In the course of investigating Mendelian recessive autism we identified six families with segregating loss-of-function mutations in the neuronal BAF (nBAF) subunit ACTL6B (originally named BAF53b). Accordingly ACTL6B was the most significantly mutated gene in the Simons Recessive Autism Cohort. At least 14 subunits of the nBAF complex are mutated in autism collectively making it a major contributor to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patient mutations destabilized ACTL6B protein in neurons and rerouted dendrites to the wrong glomerulus in the fly olfactory system. Humans and mice lacking ACTL6B showed corpus callosum hypoplasia indicating a conserved role for ACTL6B in facilitating neural connectivity. Actl6b knockout mice on two genetic backgrounds exhibited ASD-related behaviors including social and memory impairments repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity. Surprisingly mutation of Actl6b relieved repression of early response genes including AP1 transcription factors (Fos Fosl2 Fosb and Junb) increased chromatin accessibility at AP1 binding sites and transcriptional changes in late response genes associated with early response transcription factor activity. ACTL6B loss is thus an important cause of recessive ASD with impaired neuron-specific chromatin repression indicated as a potential mechanism.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085094560&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1908238117&partnerID=40&md5=83d2857c7e3bf04a37f416ff592a015e","Department of Pathology Stanford Medical School Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Genetics Stanford Medical School Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Developmental Biology Stanford Medical School Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rHoward Hughes Medical Institute Stanford University Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience University of California San Diego La Jolla CA 92037.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rHoward Hughes Medical Institute University of California San Diego La Jolla CA 92037.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rRady Children's Institute of Genomic Medicine University of California San Diego La Jolla CA 92037.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNancy Pritztker Laboratory Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Stanford Medical School Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Stanford University Palo Alto CA 94305.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Systems Medical Science Institute for Comprehensive Medical Science Fujita Health University 470-1192 Toyoake Aichi Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute for Systems Biology Seattle WA 98109.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLaboratory of Genetics The Salk Institute for Biological Studies La Jolla CA 92037.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pediatric Neurology Institute of Child Health Children Hospital Lahore 54000 Lahore Pakistan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rClinical Genetics Department Human Genetics and Genome Research Division National Research Centre 12311 Cairo Egypt.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pathology Stanford Medical School Palo Alto CA 94305; crabtree@stanford.edu jogleeson@ucsd.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neuroscience University of California San Diego La Jolla CA 92037; crabtree@stanford.edu jogleeson@ucsd.edu.",2020,"10.1073/pnas.1908238117","Article","Actins/geneticsAdenosine Triphosphate/geneticsAnimalsAutism Spectrum Disorder/*genetics/pathologyBehavior Animal/physiologyChromatin/geneticsChromatin Assembly and Disassembly/geneticsChromosomal Proteins Non-Histone/*geneticsChromosome Pairing/genetics/physiologyCorpus Callosum/metabolism/pathologyDNA-Binding Proteins/*geneticsDendrites/genetics/physiologyDisease Models AnimalGene Expression Regulation/geneticsHippocampus/metabolism/*pathologyHumansMiceMice KnockoutMutation/geneticsNeurons/metabolism/pathologyTranscription Factors/geneticsBafactivity dependentautismmouse modelrecessive","pubmed-32312822.pdf","pubmed-32312822","xml_texts/PMC7211998.xml","full_texts/10.1073%2Fpnas.1908238117.txt","full_texts/10.1073%2Fpnas.1908238117.pdf"

How loss of function of Ophn1 affects neuronal development is only partly understood. Here we have exploited adult hippocampal neurogenesis to dissect the steps of neuronal differentiation that are affected by Ophn1 deletion. We found that mice lacking Ophn1 display a reduction in the number of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. A significant fraction of the Ophn1-deficient newly generated neurons failed to extend an axon towards CA3 and showed an altered density of dendritic protrusions. Since Ophn1-deficient mice display overactivation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling we administered a clinically approved ROCK/PKA inhibitor (fasudil) to correct the neurogenesis defects. While administration of fasudil was not effective in rescuing axon formation the same treatment completely restored spine density to control levels and enhanced the long-term survival of adult-born neurons in mice lacking Ophn1. These results identify specific neurodevelopmental steps that are impacted by Ophn1 deletion and indicate that they may be at least partially corrected by pharmacological treatment.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009833815&doi=10.1016%2fj.nbd.2017.01.003&partnerID=40&md5=e312a85f27b6f9c68a9c88e059f7b595","CNR Neuroscience Institute via G.

We observe that all five localize to microtubules of the mitotic spindle in vitro and in vivo. Investigation of CHD2 provides evidence that patient-derived mutations cause a range of microtubule-related phenotypes, including disrupted localization of the protein at mitotic spindles, cell cycle stalling, DNA damage, and cell death. Lastly, we observe that ASD genetic risk is significantly enriched among tubulin-associated proteins, suggesting broader relevance. Together, these results provide additional evidence that the role of tubulin biology and cellular proliferation in ASD warrants further investigation and highlight the pitfalls of relying solely on annotated gene functions in the search for pathological mechanisms.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37366052","University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco",2023,"10.1242/dev.201515","Article","Autism spectrum disorder; Cell cycle; Chromatin; Cilia; Microtubules; Spindles; Tubulin","pubmed-37366052.pdf","pubmed-37366052","xml_texts/PMC10399978.xml","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdev.201515.txt","full_texts/10.1242%2Fdev.201515.pdf"
"NS-Pten knockout mice show sex- and age-specific differences in ultrasonic vocalizations","Binder M. S.Lugo J. N.","Brain Behav",NA,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to identify changes in quantitative and qualitative aspects of neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations USVs in neuron-subset specific (NS-Pten) knockout males and females when compared with wild-type male and female mice. BACKGROUND: One signaling cascade that plays a crucial role in the development of an autistic-like phenotype is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Mouse models that illustrate this connection include Fmr1 Tsc1 and NS-Pten-deficient mice. While numerous studies have investigated ultrasonic vocalizations in Fmr1 knockout and Tsc1 heterogenous mice none have investigated USVs in NS-Pten knockout mice using a full spectrum recording system. METHODS: We recorded ultrasonic vocalizations from NS-Pten wild-type and knockout male and female mice on postnatal days 8 and 11. On these days we measured the number and quality of calls emitted from pups when they were removed from their mothers. RESULTS: We found that knockout pups emitted fewer vocalizations for both sexes (p < .05). Knockout males had calls of a shorter duration and lower peak amplitude on day 8 while showing a shorter duration lower peak amplitude and higher peak and fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Knockout females vocalized at a lower peak amplitude and fundamental frequency and a higher peak frequency on day 8 while showing a shorter duration and a higher peak and fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Spectrographic analyses also revealed significant differences in call type for both genotypes and sexes (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that deletion of NS-Pten results in significant decreases in vocalizations across both sexes. Additionally our findings indicate that the aberrant vocalizations and increased call duration seen in other mTOR models are also present in NS-Pten knockout mice. Our study provides evidence of a connection between hyperactive mTOR signaling and neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031674238&doi=10.1002%2fbrb3.857&partnerID=40&md5=ebddbe49f7a48e464429ce4172e8c146","Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Baylor University Waco TX USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Baylor University Waco TX USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute of Biomedical Studies Baylor University Waco TX USA.",2017,"10.1002/brb3.857","Article","Age FactorsAnimalsAnimals NewbornFemaleMaleMiceMice Inbred StrainsMice KnockoutPTEN Phosphohydrolase/*geneticsPhenotypePhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolismSex FactorsUltrasonicsVocalization Animal/*physiologyPtenautism spectrum disordercommunication deficitsmaternal isolationsexually dimorphicultrasonic vocalization","pubmed-29201556.pdf","pubmed-29201556","xml_texts/PMC5698873.xml","full_texts/10.1002%2Fbrb3.857.txt","full_texts/10.1002%2Fbrb3.857.pdf"

"The Hippocampal Response to Acute Corticosterone Elevation Is Altered in a Mouse Model for Angelman Syndrome.","Viho, EMG; Punt, AM; Distel, B; Houtman, R; Kroon, J; Elgersma, Y; Meijer, OC","Int J Mol Sci",NA,"Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by the neuronal absence of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). UBE3A promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and functions as a transcriptional coregulator of nuclear hormone receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Previous studies showed anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal-dependent memory disturbances in AS mouse models. Hippocampal GR is an important regulator of the stress response and memory formation, and we therefore investigated whether the absence of UBE3A in AS mice disrupted GR signaling in the hippocampus. We first established a strong cortisol-dependent interaction between the GR ligand binding domain and a UBE3A nuclear receptor box in a high-throughput interaction screen. In vivo, we found that UBE3A-deficient AS mice displayed significantly more variation in circulating corticosterone levels throughout the day compared to wildtypes (WT), with low to undetectable levels of corticosterone at the trough of the circadian cycle. Additionally, we observed an enhanced transcriptomic response in the AS hippocampus following acute corticosterone treatment. Surprisingly, chronic corticosterone treatment showed less contrast between AS and WT mice in the hippocampus and liver transcriptomic responses. This suggests that UBE3A limits the acute stimulation of GR signaling, likely as a member of the GR transcriptional complex. Altogether, these data indicate that AS mice are more sensitive to acute glucocorticoid exposure in the brain compared to WT mice. This suggests that stress responsiveness is altered in AS which could lead to anxiety symptoms.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36613751","Erasmus MC|Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum|Precision Medicine Lab",2023,"10.3390/ijms24010303","Article","Angelman syndrome; glucocorticoid receptor; hippocampus; stress; ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A","pubmed-36613751.pdf","pubmed-36613751","xml_texts/PMC9820460.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms24010303.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fijms24010303.pdf"

Mol Ther. 2020;28(1):235-253. doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.08.018 Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy caused mainly by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the SCN1A gene, indicating haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism. Here, we tested whether catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)-mediated Scn1a gene activation can rescue Scn1a haploinsufficiency in a mouse DS model and restore physiological levels of its gene product, the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. We screened single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for their ability to stimulate Scn1a transcription in association with the dCas9 activation system. We identified a specific sgRNA that increases Scn1a gene expression levels in cell lines and primary neurons with high specificity. Nav1.1 protein levels were augmented, as was the ability of wild-type immature GABAergic interneurons to fire action potentials. A similar enhancement of Scn1a transcription was achieved in mature DS interneurons, rescuing their ability to fire. To test the therapeutic potential of this approach, we delivered the Scn1a-dCas9 activation system to DS pups using adeno-associated viruses. Parvalbumin interneurons recovered their firing ability, and febrile seizures were significantly attenuated. Our results pave the way for exploiting dCas9-based gene activation as an effective and targeted approach to DS and other disorders resulting from altered gene dosage.

Affected individuals exhibit early-onset drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. This study was carried out to determine whether reducing the abundance of the Scn8a transcript with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) would delay seizure onset and prolong survival in a mouse model of SCN8A encephalopathy. Antisense oligonucleotide treatment was tested in a conditional mouse model with Cre-dependent expression of the pathogenic patient SCN8A mutation p.Arg1872Trp (R1872 W). This model exhibits early onset of seizures, rapid progression, and 100% penetrance. An Scn1a+/− haploinsufficient mouse model of Dravet syndrome was also treated. Antisense oligonucleotide was administered by intracerebroventricular injection at postnatal day 2, followed in some cases by stereotactic injection at postnatal day 30. We observed a dose-dependent increase in length of survival from 15 to 65 days in the Scn8a-R1872W/+ mice treated with ASO. Electroencephalographic recordings were normal prior to seizure onset. Weight gain and activity in an open field were unaffected, but treated mice were less active in a wheel running assay. A single treatment with Scn8a ASO extended survival of Dravet syndrome mice from 3 weeks to &gt;5 months. Reduction of Scn8a transcript by 25% to 50% delayed seizure onset and lethality in mouse models of SCN8A encephalopathy and Dravet syndrome.

Animals that expressed approximately four times the wild-type level of MeCP2 failed to survive to weaning. Strikingly a single amino acid substitution that prevents MeCP2 from binding to the TBL1X(R1) subunit of nuclear receptor corepressor 1/2 (NCoR1/2) complexes when expressed at equivalent high levels was phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type suggesting that excessive corepressor recruitment underlies toxicity. In contrast mutations affecting the DNA-binding domain were toxic when overexpressed. As the NCoR1/2 corepressors are thought to act through histone deacetylation by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) we asked whether mutations in NCoR1 and NCoR2 that drastically reduced their ability to activate this enzyme would relieve the MeCP2 overexpression phenotype. Surprisingly severity was unaffected indicating that the catalytic activity of HDAC3 is not the mediator of toxicity.

Trio-based whole-exome sequencing and targeted re-sequencing identified recessive mutations of CRADD in six individuals with TLIS from four unrelated families of diverse ethnic backgrounds. CRADD (also known as RAIDD) is a death-domain-containing adaptor protein that oligomerizes with PIDD and caspase-2 to initiate apoptosis. TLIS variants cluster in the CRADD death domain a platform for interaction with other death-domain-containing proteins including PIDD. Although caspase-2 is expressed in the developing mammalian brain little is known about its role in cortical development. CRADD/caspase-2 signaling is implicated in neurotrophic factor withdrawal- and amyloid-β-induced dendritic spine collapse and neuronal apoptosis suggesting a role in cortical sculpting and plasticity. TLIS-associated CRADD variants do not disrupt interactions with caspase-2 or PIDD in co-immunoprecipitation assays but still abolish CRADD's ability to activate caspase-2 resulting in reduced neuronal apoptosis in vitro. Homozygous Cradd knockout mice display megalencephaly and seizures without obvious defects in cortical lamination supporting a role for CRADD/caspase-2 signaling in mammalian brain development.

"Activation of eIF4E-binding-protein-1 rescues mTORC1-induced sarcopenia by expanding lysosomal degradation capacity","Crombie E. M., Kim S., Adamson S., Dong H., Lu T. C., Wu Y., Wu Y., Levy Y., Stimple N., Lam W. M. R., Hey H. W. D., Withers D. J., Hsu A. L., Bay B. H., Ochala J., Tsai S. Y.","J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle",NA,"BACKGROUND: Chronic mTORC1 activation in skeletal muscle is linked with age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength known as sarcopenia. Genetic activation of mTORC1 by conditionally ablating mTORC1 upstream inhibitor TSC1 in skeletal muscle accelerates sarcopenia development in adult mice. Conversely genetic suppression of mTORC1 downstream effectors of protein synthesis delays sarcopenia in natural aging mice. mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis by activating ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and inhibiting eIF4E-binding proteins (4EBPs). Whole-body knockout of S6K1 or muscle-specific over-expression of a 4EBP1 mutant transgene (4EBP1mt) which is resistant to mTORC1-mediated inhibition ameliorates muscle loss with age and preserves muscle function by enhancing mitochondria activities despite both transgenic mice showing retarded muscle growth at a young age. Why repression of mTORC1-mediated protein synthesis can mitigate progressive muscle atrophy and dysfunction with age remains unclear. METHODS: Mice with myofiber-specific knockout of TSC1 (TSC1mKO) in which mTORC1 is hyperactivated in fully differentiated myofibers were used as a mouse model of sarcopenia. To elucidate the role of mTORC1-mediated protein synthesis in regulating muscle mass and physiology we bred the 4EBP1mt transgene or S6k1 floxed mice into the TSC1mKO mouse background to generate 4EBP1mt-TSC1mKO or S6K1-TSC1mKO mice respectively. Functional and molecular analyses were performed to assess their role in sarcopenia development. RESULTS: Here we show that 4EBP1mt-TSC1mKO but not S6K1-TSC1mKO preserved muscle mass (36.7% increase compared with TSC1mKO P < 0.001) and strength (36.8% increase compared with TSC1mKO P < 0.01) at the level of control mice. Mechanistically 4EBP1 activation suppressed aberrant protein synthesis (two-fold reduction compared with TSC1mKO P < 0.05) and restored autophagy flux without relieving mTORC1-mediated inhibition of ULK1 an upstream activator of autophagosome initiation. We discovered a previously unidentified phenotype of lysosomal failure in TSC1mKO mouse muscle in which the lysosomal defect was also conserved in the naturally aged mouse muscle whereas 4EBP1 activation enhanced lysosomal protease activities to compensate for impaired autophagy induced by mTORC1 hyperactivity. Consequently 4EBP1 activation relieved oxidative stress to prevent toxic aggregate accumulation (0.5-fold reduction compared with TSC1mKO P < 0.05) in muscle and restored mitochondrial homeostasis and function.

Previous gene deletion study revealed a role for PRL2 in spermatogenesis. We report here the first knockout mice lacking PRL1 the most related homolog of PRL2. We found that loss of PRL1 does not affect spermatogenesis and reproductive ability of male mice likely due to functional compensation by the relatively higher expression of PRL2 in the testes. However PRL1(-/-)/PRL2(+/-) male mice show testicular atrophy phenotype similar to PRL2(-/-) mice. More strikingly deletion of one PRL1 allele in PRL2(-/-) male mice causes complete infertility. Mechanistically the total level of PRL1 and PRL2 is negatively correlated with the PTEN protein level in the testis and PRL1(+/-)/PRL2(-/-) mice have the highest level of PTEN leading to attenuated Akt activation and increased germ cell apoptosis effectively halting spermatozoa production. These results provide the first evidence that in addition to PRL2 PRL1 is also required for spermatogenesis by downregulating PTEN and promoting Akt signaling. The ability of the PRLs to suppress PTEN expression underscores the biochemical basis for their oncogenic potential.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988835871&doi=10.1038%2fsrep34211&partnerID=40&md5=2f04fb605ee78e8759a70a3feda94ca2","Departments of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and of Chemistry Purdue Center for Cancer Research and Purdue Center for Drug Discovery Purdue University 575 Stadium Mall Drive West Lafayette IN 47907 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Indianapolis IN 46202 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInstitute of Molecular and Cell Biology A*STAR (Agency for Science Technology and Research) 61 Biopolis Drive Proteos Singapore 138673 Republic of Singapore.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pediatrics Indiana University School of Medicine Indianapolis IN 46202 USA.",2016,"10.1038/srep34211","Article",NA,"pubmed-27666520.pdf","pubmed-27666520","xml_texts/PMC5035919.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fsrep34211.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fsrep34211.pdf"

We report here that Rac1(N) /Rac3(KO) mice display a progressive loss of immune-competence. Comparative longitudinal analysis of lymphoid organs from control single Rac1(N) or Rac3(KO)  and double Rac1(N) /Rac3(KO) mutant animals showed that thymus development is preserved up to postnatal day 9 in all animals but is impaired in Rac1(N) /Rac3(KO) mice at later times. This is evidenced by a drastic reduction in thymic cell numbers. Cell numbers were also reduced in the spleen leading to splenic tissue disarray. Organ involution occurs in spite of unaltered thymocyte and lymphocyte subset composition and proper mature T-cell responses to polyclonal stimuli in vitro. Suboptimal thymus innervation by tau-positive neuronal terminals possibly explains the suboptimal thymic output and arrested thymic development which is accompanied by higher apoptotic rates. Our results support a role for neuronal Rac1 and Rac3 in dictating proper lymphoid organ development and suggest the existence of lymphoid-extrinsic mechanisms linking neural defects to the loss of immune-competence.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955157221&doi=10.1002%2feji.201040892&partnerID=40&md5=369a99f588077b3d690ebf75f31c33a6","Lymphocyte Activation Unit Division of Immunology Transplantation and Infectious Diseases San Raffaele Scientific Institute Milan Italy.",2011,"10.1002/eji.201040892","Article","AnimalsApoptosisCell DifferentiationCentral Nervous System/immunology/metabolismFlow Cytometry*ImmunocompetenceMiceMice KnockoutNeurons/*physiologySpleen/cytology/growth & development/*immunologyThymus Gland/cytology/growth & development/*immunology/innervationrac GTP-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiologyrac1 GTP-Binding Protein/deficiency/genetics/*physiology","pubmed-21469092.pdf","pubmed-21469092","xml_texts/PMC3132589.xml","full_texts/10.1002%2Feji.201040892.txt","full_texts/10.1002%2Feji.201040892.pdf"

"The neuronal protein Neurexin directly interacts with the Scribble-Pix complex to stimulate F-actin assembly for synaptic vesicle clustering","Rui M.Qian J.Liu L.Cai Y.Lv H.Han J.Jia Z.Xie W.","J Biol Chem",NA,"Synaptic vesicles (SVs) form distinct pools at synaptic terminals and this well-regulated separation is necessary for normal neurotransmission. However how the SV cluster in particular synaptic compartments maintains normal neurotransmitter release remains a mystery. The presynaptic protein Neurexin (NRX) plays a significant role in synaptic architecture and function and some evidence suggests that NRX is associated with neurological disorders including autism spectrum disorders. However the role of NRX in SV clustering is unclear. Here using the neuromuscular junction at the 2-3 instar stages of Drosophila larvae as a model and biochemical imaging and electrophysiology techniques we demonstrate that Drosophila NRX (DNRX) plays critical roles in regulating synaptic terminal clustering and release of SVs. We found that DNRX controls the terminal clustering and release of SVs by stimulating presynaptic F-actin. Furthermore our results indicate that DNRX functions through the scaffold protein Scribble and the GEF protein DPix to activate the small GTPase Ras-related C3 Botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). We observed a direct interaction between the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DNRX and the PDZ domains of Scribble and that Scribble bridges DNRX to DPix forming a DNRX-Scribble-DPix complex that activates Rac1 and subsequently stimulates presynaptic F-actin assembly and SV clustering. Taken together our work provides important insights into the function of DNRX in regulating SV clustering which could help inform further research into pathological neurexin-mediated mechanisms in neurological disorders such as autism.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028860064&doi=10.1074%2fjbc.M117.794040&partnerID=40&md5=4392178b1cea3a881da776a55e228e38","From Key Laboratory of Developmental Genes and Human Disease Institute of Life Sciences Southeast University Nanjing 210096 China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rthe Institute of Life Sciences the Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science Southeast University Nanjing 210096 China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rthe Department of Neurosciences and Mental Health The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto Ontario M5G 1X8 Canada and.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rthe Department of Physiology Faculty of Medicine University of Toronto Toronto Ontario M5S 1A8 Canada.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rFrom Key Laboratory of Developmental Genes and Human Disease Institute of Life Sciences Southeast University Nanjing 210096 China wei.xie@seu.edu.cn.",2017,"10.1074/jbc.m117.794040","Article","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismActin Cytoskeleton/*metabolismAnimalsAnimals Genetically ModifiedCell Adhesion Molecules Neuronal/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismDrosophila Proteins/agonists/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismDrosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/growth & development/*metabolismElectrophysiological PhenomenaGene DeletionGreen Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolismHEK293 CellsHumansLarva/cytology/genetics/growth & development/metabolismMembrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismMutationNerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolismNeuromuscular Junction/cytology/growth & development/*metabolismPeptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolismProtein Interaction Domains and MotifsProtein MultimerizationRecombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolismSynaptic Vesicles/*metabolismrac GTP-Binding Proteins/agonists/chemistry/metabolismDrosophilaactincell adhesionsynapsevesicles","pubmed-28710284.pdf","pubmed-28710284","xml_texts/PMC5582829.xml","full_texts/10.1074%2Fjbc.m117.794040.txt","full_texts/10.1074%2Fjbc.m117.794040.pdf"

In this work we characterized the FMRP binding site (FBS) within the FMR1 mRNA by a site directed mutagenesis approach and we investigated its importance for FMR1 expression. We show that the FBS in the FMR1 mRNA adopts two alternative G-quartet structures to which FMRP can equally bind. While FMRP binding to mRNAs is generally proposed to induce translational regulation we found that mutations in the FMR1 mRNA suppressing binding to FMRP do not affect its translation in cellular models. We show instead that the FBS is a potent exonic splicing enhancer in a minigene system. Furthermore FMR1 alternative splicing is affected by the intracellular level of FMRP.

I.","Mol Autism",NA,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) like many neurodevelopmental disorders has complex and varied etiologies. Advances in genome sequencing have identified multiple candidate genes associated with ASD including dozens of missense and nonsense mutations in the NMDAR subunit GluN2B encoded by GRIN2B. NMDARs are glutamate-gated ion channels with key synaptic functions in excitatory neurotransmission. How alterations in these proteins impact neurodevelopment is poorly understood in part because knockouts of GluN2B in rodents are lethal. METHODS: Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate zebrafish lacking GluN2B (grin2B(-/-)). Using these fish we run an array of behavioral tests and perform whole-brain larval imaging to assay developmental roles and functions of GluN2B. RESULTS: We demonstrate that zebrafish GluN2B displays similar structural and functional properties to human GluN2B. Zebrafish lacking GluN2B (grin2B(-/-)) surprisingly survive into adulthood. Given the prevalence of social deficits in ASD we assayed social preference in the grin2B(-/-) fish. Wild-type fish develop a strong social preference by 3 weeks post fertilization. In contrast grin2B(-/-) fish at this age exhibit significantly reduced social preference. Notably the lack of GluN2B does not result in a broad disruption of neurodevelopment as grin2B(-/-) larvae do not show alterations in spontaneous or photic-evoked movements are capable of prey capture and exhibit learning. Whole-brain imaging of grin2B(-/-) larvae revealed reduction of an inhibitory neuron marker in the subpallium a region linked to ASD in humans but showed that overall brain size and E/I balance in grin2B(-/-) is comparable to wild type. LIMITATIONS: Zebrafish lacking GluN2B while useful in studying developmental roles of GluN2B are unlikely to model nuanced functional alterations of human missense mutations that are not complete loss of function. Additionally detailed mammalian homologies for larval zebrafish brain subdivisions at the age of whole-brain imaging are not fully resolved. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that zebrafish completely lacking the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR unlike rodent models are viable into adulthood. Notably they exhibit a highly specific deficit in social behavior. As such this zebrafish model affords a unique opportunity to study the roles of GluN2B in ASD etiologies and establish a disease-relevant in vivo model for future studies.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138429336&doi=10.1186%2fs13229-022-00516-3&partnerID=40&md5=729dc0ec150eef727d42ac7522c53888","Graduate Program in Neuroscience Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurobiology and Behavior Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rGraduate Program in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Developmental Biology Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Bethesda MD USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biochemistry and Cell Biology Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCenter for Nervous System Disorders Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurobiology and Behavior Stony Brook University Stony Brook NY 11794-5230 USA. howard.sirotkin@stonybrook.edu.",2022,"10.1186/s13229-022-00516-3","Article","AnimalsCodon NonsenseGlutamic Acid*Neurodevelopmental Disorders/genetics*Receptors N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics*Zebrafish/geneticsAutism spectrum disordersGluN2BNMDA receptorsSocial behaviors","pubmed-36138431.pdf","pubmed-36138431","xml_texts/PMC9502958.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00516-3.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00516-3.pdf"

During development emergence of Hebbian plasticity leads to formation of functional circuits. By modeling the dynamics of neurotransmitter release during early postnatal cortical development we show that a developmentally regulated switch in vesicle exocytosis mode triggers associative (i.e. Hebbian) plasticity. Early in development spontaneous vesicle exocytosis (SVE) often considered as 'synaptic noise' is important for homogenization of synaptic weights and maintenance of synaptic weights in the appropriate dynamic range. Our results demonstrate that SVE has a permissive whereas subsequent evoked vesicle exocytosis (EVE) has an instructive role in the expression of Hebbian plasticity. A timed onset for Hebbian plasticity can be achieved by switching from SVE to EVE and the balance between SVE and EVE can control the effective rate of Hebbian plasticity. We further show that this developmental switch in neurotransmitter release mode enables maturation of spike-timing dependent plasticity. A mis-timed or inadequate SVE to EVE switch may lead to malformation of brain networks thereby contributing to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,"Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour Centre for Neuroscience Department of Neuroinformatics Radboud University Nijmegen Nijmegen The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDonders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour Centre for Neuroscience Department of Neurophysiology Radboud University Nijmegen Nijmegen The Netherlands.",2015,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004386","Article","Aging/*physiologyAnimalsHumansLearning/physiology*Models NeurologicalNerve Net/physiologyNeuronal Plasticity/*physiologyNeurotransmitter Agents/*metabolismSynapses/*physiologySynaptic Transmission/*physiology","pubmed-26172394.pdf","pubmed-26172394","xml_texts/PMC4501799.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004386.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004386.pdf"
"Evolutionarily conserved roles of foxg1a in the developing subpallium of zebrafish embryos.","Umeda, K; Tanaka, K; Chowdhury, G; Nasu, K; Kuroyanagi, Y; Yamasu, K","Dev Growth Differ",NA,"The vertebrate telencephalic lobes consist of the pallium (dorsal) and subpallium (ventral). The subpallium gives rise to the basal ganglia, encompassing the pallidum and striatum. The development of this region is believed to depend on Foxg1/Foxg1a functions in both mice and zebrafish. This study aims to elucidate the genetic regulatory network controlled by foxg1a in subpallium development using zebrafish as a model. The expression gradient of foxg1a within the developing telencephalon was examined semi-quantitatively in initial investigations. Utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we subsequently established a foxg1a mutant line and observed the resultant phenotypes. Morphological assessment revealed that foxg1a mutants exhibit a thin telencephalon together with a misshapen preoptic area (POA). Notably, accumulation of apoptotic cells was identified in this region. In mutants at 24 h postfertilization, the expression of pallium markers expanded ventrally, while that of subpallium markers was markedly suppressed. Concurrently, the expression of fgf8a, vax2, and six3b was shifted ventrally, causing anomalous expression in regions typical of POA formation in wild-type embryos. Consequently, the foxg1a mutation led to expansion of the pallium and disrupted the subpallium and POA. This highlights a pivotal role of foxg1a in directing the dorsoventral patterning of the telencephalon, particularly in subpallium differentiation, mirroring observations in mice. Additionally, reduced expression of neural progenitor maintenance genes was detected in mutants, suggesting the necessity of foxg1a in preserving neural progenitors. Collectively, these findings underscore evolutionarily conserved functions of foxg1 in the development of the subpallium in vertebrate embryos.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38378191",NA,2024,"10.1111/dgd.12917","Article","CRISPR/Cas9; foxg1/foxg1a; pallium; subpallium; zebrafish","pubmed-38378191.pdf","pubmed-38378191","xml_texts/PMC11457518.xml","full_texts/10.1111%2Fdgd.12917.txt","full_texts/10.1111%2Fdgd.12917.pdf"
"Experience-dependent changes in hippocampal spatial activity and hippocampal circuit function are disrupted in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome.","Asiminas, A; Booker, SA; Dando, OR; Kozic, Z; Arkell, D; Inkpen, FH; Sumera, A; Akyel, I; Kind, PC; Wood, ER","Mol Autism",NA,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common single gene cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive inflexibility is one of the hallmarks of FXS with affected individuals showing extreme difficulty adapting to novel or complex situations. To explore the neural correlates of this cognitive inflexibility, we used a rat model of FXS (Fmr1 -/y ). We recorded from the CA1 in Fmr1 -/y  and WT littermates over six 10-min exploration sessions in a novel environment-three sessions per day (ITI 10 min). Our recordings yielded 288 and 246 putative pyramidal cells from 7 WT and 7 Fmr1 -/y  rats, respectively. On the first day of exploration of a novel environment, the firing rate and spatial tuning of CA1 pyramidal neurons was similar between wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 -/y  rats. However, while CA1 pyramidal neurons from WT rats showed experience-dependent changes in firing and spatial tuning between the first and second day of exposure to the environment, these changes were decreased or absent in CA1 neurons of Fmr1 -/y  rats. These findings were consistent with increased excitability of Fmr1 -/y  CA1 neurons in ex vivo hippocampal slices, which correlated with reduced synaptic inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex. Lastly, activity patterns of CA1 pyramidal neurons were dis-coordinated with respect to hippocampal oscillatory activity in Fmr1 -/y  rats. It is still unclear how the observed circuit function abnormalities give rise to behavioural deficits in Fmr1 -/y  rats. Future experiments will focus on this connection as well as the contribution of other neuronal cell types in the hippocampal circuit pathophysiology associated with the loss of FMRP. It would also be interesting to see if hippocampal circuit deficits converge with those seen in other rodent models of intellectual disability. In conclusion, we found that hippocampal place cells from Fmr1 -/y  rats show similar spatial firing properties as those from WT rats but do not show the same experience-dependent increase in spatial specificity or the experience-dependent changes in network coordination. Our findings offer support to a network-level origin of cognitive deficits in FXS.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36536454","Edinburgh Medical School|Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences|Centre for Brain Development and Repair",2022,"10.1186/s13229-022-00528-z","Article",NA,"pubmed-36536454.pdf","pubmed-36536454","xml_texts/PMC9764562.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00528-z.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-022-00528-z.pdf"
"Grin1 Receptor Deletion within CRF Neurons Enhances Fear Memory","Gafford G., Jasnow A. M., Ressler K. J.","PLoS One",NA,"Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) dysregulation is implicated in mood and anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CRF is expressed in areas engaged in fear and anxiety processing including the central amygdala (CeA). Complicating our ability to study the contribution of CRF-containing neurons to fear and anxiety behavior is the wide variety of cell types in which CRF is expressed. To manipulate specific subpopulations of CRF containing neurons our lab has developed a mouse with a Cre recombinase gene driven by a CRF promoter (CRFp3.0Cre) (Martin et al. 2010). In these studies mice that have the gene that encodes NR1 (Grin1) flanked by loxP sites (floxed) were crossed with our previously developed CRFp3.0Cre mouse to selectively disrupt Grin1 within CRF containing neurons (Cre+/(fGrin1+)). We find that disruption of Grin1 in CRF neurons did not affect baseline levels of anxiety locomotion pain sensitivity or exploration of a novel object. However baseline expression of Grin1 was decreased in Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice as measured by RTPCR. Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice showed enhanced auditory fear acquisition and retention without showing any significant effect on fear extinction. We measured Gria1 the gene that encodes AMPAR1 and the CREB activator Creb1 in the amygdala of Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice after fear conditioning. Both Gria1 and Creb1 were enhanced in the amygdala after training. To determine if the Grin1-expressing CRF neurons within the CeA are responsible for the enhancement of fear memory in adults we infused a lentivirus with Cre driven by a CRF promoter (LV pCRF-Cre/(fGrin1+)) into the CeA of floxed Grin1 mice. Cre driven deletion of Grin1 specifically within CRF expressing cells in the CeA also resulted in enhanced fear memory acquisition and retention. Altogether these findings suggest that selective disruption of Grin1 within CeA CRF neurons strongly enhances fear memory.",NA,NA,2014,"10.1371/journal.pone.0111009","Article",NA,"wos-000343662800078.pdf","wos-000343662800078","xml_texts/PMC4207780.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0111009.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0111009.pdf"
"Neuronal megalin mediates synaptic plasticity-a novel mechanism underlying intellectual disabilities in megalin gene pathologies","Gomes J. R.Lobo A.Nogueira R.Terceiro A. F.Costelha S.Lopes I. M.Magalhães A.Summavielle T.Saraiva M. J.","Brain Commun",NA,"Donnai-Barrow syndrome a genetic disorder associated to LRP2 (low-density lipoprotein receptor 2/megalin) mutations is characterized by unexplained neurological symptoms and intellectual deficits. Megalin is a multifunctional endocytic clearance cell-surface receptor mostly described in epithelial cells. This receptor is also expressed in the CNS mainly in neurons being involved in neurite outgrowth and neuroprotective mechanisms. Yet the mechanisms involved in the regulation of megalin in the CNS are poorly understood. Using transthyretin knockout mice a megalin ligand we found that transthyretin positively regulates neuronal megalin levels in different CNS areas particularly in the hippocampus. Transthyretin is even able to rescue megalin downregulation in transthyretin knockout hippocampal neuronal cultures in a positive feedback mechanism via megalin. Importantly transthyretin activates a regulated intracellular proteolysis mechanism of neuronal megalin producing an intracellular domain which is translocated to the nucleus unveiling megalin C-terminal as a potential transcription factor able to regulate gene expression. We unveil that neuronal megalin reduction affects physiological neuronal activity leading to decreased neurite number length and branching and increasing neuronal susceptibility to a toxic insult. Finally we unravel a new unexpected role of megalin in synaptic plasticity by promoting the formation and maturation of dendritic spines and contributing for the establishment of active synapses both in in vitro and in vivo hippocampal neurons. Moreover these structural and synaptic roles of megalin impact on learning and memory mechanisms since megalin heterozygous mice show hippocampal-related memory and learning deficits in several behaviour tests. Altogether we unveil a complete novel role of megalin in the physiological neuronal activity mainly in synaptic plasticity with impact in learning and memory. Importantly we contribute to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive and intellectual disabilities related to megalin gene pathologies.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111094479&doi=10.1093%2fbraincomms%2ffcaa135&partnerID=40&md5=e95992c80cf95033e4a2c18baf21ca6a","Molecular Neurobiology Unit IBMC- Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular 4200-135 Porto Portugal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rI3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde Universidade do Porto 4200-135 Porto Portugal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAddiction Biology Group IBMC- Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular 4200-135 Porto Portugal.",2020,"10.1093/braincomms/fcaa135","Article","Donnai-Barrow syndromehippocampuslearning and memorymegalinsynaptic plasticity","pubmed-33225275.pdf","pubmed-33225275","xml_texts/PMC7667529.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa135.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fbraincomms%2Ffcaa135.pdf"

We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2) and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 neutralizes PRC1 repressive activity whereas AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association.

Clinical symptoms of heterotopia vary in severity of intellectual disability and may be associated with epileptic disorders. Abnormal neuronal migration is known to be associated with mutations in the doublecortin gene (DCX), the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase gene (PAFAH1B1), or tubulin alpha-1A gene (TUBA1A). Recently, a new gene encoding echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 1 (EML1) was reported to cause a particular form of subcortical heterotopia, the ribbon-like subcortical heterotopia (RSH). EML1 mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Only six unrelated EML1-associated heterotopia-affected families were reported so far. The EML1 protein is a member of the microtubule-associated proteins family, playing an important role in microtubule assembly and stabilization as well as in mitotic spindle formation in interphase.

H.Enz R.Dahlhaus R.","Plos one",NA,"A strict regulation of protein expression during developmental stages and in response to environmental signals is essential to every cell and organism. Recent research has shown that the mammalian brain is particularly sensitive to alterations in expression patterns of specific proteins and cognitive deficits as well as autistic behaviours have been linked to dysregulated protein expression. An intellectual disability characterised by changes in the expression of a variety of proteins is the fragile X syndrome. Due to the loss of a single mRNA binding protein the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein FMRP vast misregulation of the mRNA metabolism is taking place in the disease. Here we present the identification and characterisation of a novel protein named Simiate whose mRNA contains several FMRP recognition motifs and associates with FMRP upon co-precipitation. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein evolved app. 1.7 billion years ago when eukaryotes developed. Applying antibodies generated against Simiate the protein is detected in a variety of tissues including the mammalian brain. On the subcellular level Simiate localises to somata and nuclear speckles. We show that Simiate and nuclear speckles experience specific alterations in FMR1(-/-) mice. An antibody-based block of endogenous Simiate revealed that the protein is essential for cell survival. These findings suggest not only an important role for Simiate in gene transcription and/or RNA splicing but also provide evidence for a function of nuclear speckles in the fragile X syndrome. Indeed transcription and splicing are two fundamental mechanisms to control protein expression that underlie not only synaptic plasticity and memory formation but are also affected in several diseases associated with mental disabilities.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892417531&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0083007&partnerID=40&md5=51b24dbf71255ae055c0ba5112a8f629","Institute for Biochemistry Emil-Fischer Centre University of Erlangen-Nuremberg Erlangen Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Animal Physiology University of Erlangen- Nuremberg Erlangen Germany.",2013,"10.1371/journal.pone.0083007","Article","Amino Acid MotifsAnimalsEvolution MolecularFragile X Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism/pathologyHEK293 CellsHumansMemoryMiceMice KnockoutNeuronal PlasticityNuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism*RNA SplicingRNA MessengerRatsSequence Analysis ProteinTranscription Factors/genetics/*metabolism*Transcription Genetic","pubmed-24349419.pdf","pubmed-24349419","xml_texts/PMC3859600.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083007.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083007.pdf"

The hippocampus a brain region that is critical for learning and memory contains a large number of neurons that develop in the early postnatal period which are thus vulnerable to perturbation by anesthetic exposure. Using an in vivo mouse model we demonstrate abnormal development of dendrite arbors and dendritic spines in newly generated dentate gyrus granule cell neurons of the hippocampus after a clinically relevant isoflurane anesthesia exposure conducted at an early postnatal age. Furthermore we find that isoflurane causes a sustained increase in activity in the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway and that inhibition of this pathway with rapamycin not only reverses the observed changes in neuronal development but also substantially improves performance on behavioral tasks of spatial learning and memory that are impaired by isoflurane exposure.

A different set of GABAergic precursors cells that express Pax2 migrate to hindbrain regions, targeting, for example auditory or somatosensory brainstem regions. We demonstrate that the absence of BDNF in Pax2-lineage descendants of BdnfPax2KOs causes severe cognitive disabilities. In BdnfPax2KOs, a normal number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) was found in the auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal regions, which went hand in hand with reduced PV-labeling in neuropil domains and elevated activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1; here: Arc) levels in pyramidal neurons in these same regions. This immaturity in the inhibitory/excitatory balance of the AC and hippocampus was accompanied by elevated LTP, reduced (sound-induced) LTP/LTD adjustment, impaired learning, elevated anxiety, and deficits in social behavior, overall representing an autistic-like phenotype. Reduced tonic inhibitory strength and elevated spontaneous firing rates in dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) brainstem neurons in otherwise nearly normal hearing BdnfPax2KOs suggests that diminished fine-grained auditory-specific brainstem activity has hampered activity-driven integration of inhibitory networks of the AC in functional (hippocampal) circuits. This leads to an inability to scale hippocampal post-synapses during LTP/LTD plasticity. BDNF in Pax2-lineage descendants in lower brain regions should thus be considered as a novel candidate for contributing to the development of brain disorders, including autism. © Copyright © 2021 Eckert, Marchetta, Manthey, Walter, Jovanovic, Savitska, Singer, Jacob, Rüttiger, Schimmang, Milenkovic, Pilz and Knipper.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103908280&doi=10.3389%2ffnmol.2021.642679&partnerID=40&md5=b88d874bf8e5e6244076645705595f79","Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Tübingen Hearing Research Centre, Molecular Physiology of Hearing, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany; Department of Neuroscience, Sackler School of Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States; Department for Animal Physiology, Institute of Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany; School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; Instituto de Biología y Genética Molecular, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain",2021,"10.3389/fnmol.2021.642679","Article","alkaline phosphatase; atropine; brain derived neurotrophic factor; corticosterone; fentanyl; ketamine; medetomidine; midazolam; parvalbumin; transcription factor PAX2; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anterior hypothalamus; Article; auditory cortex; autism; brain blood flow; brain development; brain disease; brain region; cognitive defect; corpus callosum; cytoskeleton; decapitation; dorsal cochlear nucleus; electroencephalography; excitatory postsynaptic potential; firing rate; GABAergic transmission; gene deletion; hippocampal sclerosis; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; interneuron; learning disorder; mental disease; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; neuropil; nonhuman; open field test; phenotype; postsynaptic potential; protein domain; pyramidal nerve cell; receptive field; somatosensory cortex; synapse; upregulation","scopus-85103908280.pdf","scopus-85103908280","xml_texts/PMC8033028.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2021.642679.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2021.642679.pdf"

It has been documented that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) ameliorates core symptoms in patients with ASD. We recently reported that chronic administration of intranasal OXT reversed social and learning impairments in prenatally valproic acid (VPA)-exposed rats. However the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we explored molecular alterations in the hippocampus of rats and the effects of chronic administration of intranasal OXT (12 μg/kg/d). Microarray analyses revealed that prenatal VPA exposure altered gene expression a part of which is suggested as a candidate in ASD and is involved in key features including memory developmental processes and epilepsy. OXT partly improved the expression of these genes which were predicted to interact with those involved in social behaviors and hippocampal-dependent memory. Collectively the present study documented molecular profiling in the hippocampus related to ASD and improvement by chronic treatment with OXT.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128434538&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyt.2022.859198&partnerID=40&md5=746eb9c18bf32a30b9be0ac82fd9d9ae","Department of Pharmacology Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Tohoku University Sendai Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Neurofunctional Genomics Department of Immunobiology and Neuroscience Medical Institute of Bioregulation Kyushu University Fukuoka Japan.",2022,"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.859198","Article","autism spectrum disordershippocampusoxytocintranscriptome analysisvalproic acid","pubmed-35432011.pdf","pubmed-35432011","xml_texts/PMC9005872.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.859198.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.859198.pdf"
"Conditional ablation of neuroligin-1 in CA1 pyramidal neurons blocks LTP by a cell-autonomous NMDA receptor-independent mechanism","Jiang M.Polepalli J.Chen L. Y.Zhang B.Südhof T. C.Malenka R. C.","Mol Psychiatry",NA,"Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules implicated in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite extensive work the role of neuroligins in synapse function and plasticity especially N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) remains unclear. To establish which synaptic functions unequivocally require neuroligins we analyzed single and triple conditional knockout (cKO) mice for all three major neuroligin isoforms (NL1-NL3). We inactivated neuroligins by stereotactic viral expression of Cre-recombinase in hippocampal CA1 region pyramidal neurons at postnatal day 0 (P0) or day 21 (P21) and measured synaptic function synaptic plasticity and spine numbers in acute hippocampal slices 2-3 weeks later. Surprisingly we find that ablation of neuroligins in newborn or juvenile mice only modestly impaired basal synaptic function in hippocampus and caused no alteration in postsynaptic spine numbers. However triple cKO of NL1-NL3 or single cKO of NL1 impaired NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and abolished NMDAR-dependent LTP. Strikingly the NL1 cKO also abolished LTP elicited by activation of L-type Ca(2+)-channels during blockade of NMDARs. These findings demonstrate that neuroligins are generally not essential for synapse formation in CA1 pyramidal neurons but shape synaptic properties and that NL1 specifically is required for LTP induced by postsynaptic Ca(2+)-elevations a function which may contribute to the pathophysiological role of neuroligins in brain disorders.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969857998&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2016.80&partnerID=40&md5=d4842816ab434b9dbff833edaeafc9b6","Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology Stanford University School of Medicine Stanford CA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rHoward Hughes Medical Institute Stanford University Stanford CA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNancy Pritzker Laboratory Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Stanford University School of Medicine Stanford CA USA.",2017,"10.1038/mp.2016.80","Article","AnimalsCA1 Region Hippocampal/*metabolismCell Adhesion Molecules Neuronal/genetics/*metabolismElectric StimulationExcitatory Postsynaptic Potentials/physiologyHippocampus/metabolismLong-Term Potentiation/geneticsMaleMembrane Proteins/metabolismMiceMice KnockoutNerve Tissue Proteins/metabolismNeuronal Plasticity/physiologyPatch-Clamp TechniquesPyramidal Cells/metabolismReceptors N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics/metabolismSynapses/metabolismSynaptic Transmission/physiology","pubmed-27217145.pdf","pubmed-27217145","xml_texts/PMC5122464.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fmp.2016.80.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fmp.2016.80.pdf"

Families with inherited Netrin-1 mutations display congenital mirror movements (CMM), which are associated with malformations of pyramidal decussation in most cases. Here, we investigated the role of Netrin-1 in CST formation by generating conditional knockout (CKO) mice using a Gfap-driven Cre line. A large proportion of CST axons spread laterally in the ventral medulla oblongata, failed to decussate and descended in the ipsilateral spinal white matter of Ntn1 Gfap  CKO mice. Netrin-1 mRNA was expressed in the ventral ventricular zone (VZ) and midline, while Netrin-1 protein was transported by radial glial cells to the ventral medulla, through which CST axons pass. The level of transported Netrin-1 protein was significantly reduced in Ntn1 Gfap  CKO mice. In addition, Ntn1 Gfap  CKO mice displayed increased symmetric movements. Our findings indicate that VZ-derived Netrin-1 deletion leads to an abnormal trajectory of the CST in the spinal cord due to the failure of CST midline crossing and provides novel evidence supporting the idea that the Netrin-1 signalling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of CMM.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38760361",NA,2024,"10.1038/s41419-024-06719-1","Article",NA,"pubmed-38760361.pdf","pubmed-38760361","xml_texts/PMC11101614.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41419-024-06719-1.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41419-024-06719-1.pdf"

We have now shown that Setd5(+/-) mice manifest ASD-related behavioral phenotypes and that the expression of ribosomal protein genes and rDNA is disturbed in the brain of these mice. SETD5 recruited the HDAC3 complex to the rDNA promoter resulting in removal of the histone mark H4K16ac and its reader protein TIP5 a repressor of rDNA expression. Depletion of SETD5 attenuated rDNA expression translational activity and neural cell proliferation whereas ablation of TIP5 in SETD5-deficient cells rescued these effects. Translation of cyclin D1 mRNA was specifically down-regulated in SETD5-insufficient cells.

Genetic studies have identified numerous candidate genetic variants including de novo mutated ASD-associated genes; however the function of these de novo mutated genes remains unclear despite extensive bioinformatics resources. Accordingly it is not easy to assign priorities to numerous candidate ASD-associated genes for further biological analysis. Here we developed a convenient system for identifying an experimental evidence-based annotation of candidate ASD-associated genes. We performed trio-based whole-exome sequencing in 30 sporadic cases of ASD and identified 37 genes with de novo single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). Among them 5 of those 37 genes POGZ PLEKHA4 PCNX PRKD2 and HERC1 have been previously reported as genes with de novo SNVs in ASD; and consultation with in silico databases showed that only HERC1 might be involved in neural function. To examine whether the identified gene products are involved in neural functions we performed small hairpin RNA-based assays using neuroblastoma cell lines to assess neurite development. Knockdown of 8 out of the 14 examined genes significantly decreased neurite development (P<0.05 one-way analysis of variance) which was significantly higher than the number expected from gene ontology databases (P=0.010 Fisher's exact test). Our screening system may be valuable for identifying the neural functions of candidate ASD-associated genes for further analysis and a substantial portion of these genes with de novo SNVs might have roles in neuronal systems although further detailed analysis might eliminate false positive genes from identified candidate ASD genes.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962014064&doi=10.1038%2fjhg.2015.141&partnerID=40&md5=3ffd81e4ddad6b4b5d63ef252638172d","Molecular Research Center for Children's Mental Development United Graduate School of Child Development Osaka University Osaka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine Osaka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\riPS Cell-Based Research Project on Brain Neuropharmacology and Toxicology Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Osaka University Osaka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Human Genetics Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine Yokohama Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rLaboratory of Molecular Neuropharmacology Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Osaka University Osaka Japan.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rGenomic Science Laboratories Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co.

The serotonergic system is one of the earliest to develop during embryogenesis and early changes in serotonin levels can have large consequences for the correct development of specific brain areas. The regulation and functioning of serotonin is influenced by genetic risk factors such as the serotonin transporter polymorphism in humans. This polymorphism is associated with anxiety-related symptoms changes in social behavior and cortical gray and white matter changes also seen in patients suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The human polymorphism can be mimicked by the knockout of the serotonin transporter in rodents which are as a model system therefore vital to explore the precise neurobiological mechanisms. Moreover there are pharmacological challenges influencing serotonin in early life like prenatal/neonatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in depressed pregnant women. There is accumulating evidence that this dysregulation of serotonin during critical phases of brain development can lead to ASD-related symptoms in children and reduced social behavior and increased anxiety in rodents. Furthermore prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure a mood stabilizing drug which is also thought to interfere with serotonin levels has the potency to induce ASD-like symptoms and to affect the development of the serotonergic system.

The emerging relevance of DNMT and TET-mediated functions for synaptic regulation irrevocably raises the question for the targeted subcellular processes and mechanisms. In this study we analyzed the role dynamic DNA methylation has in regulating cortical interneuron function. We found that DNMT1 and TET1/TET3 contrarily modulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover we provide evidence that DNMT1 influences synaptic vesicle replenishment and GABAergic transmission presumably through the DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional control over endocytosis-related genes.

C.","Front Mol Neurosci",NA,"Astrocyte dysfunction has been indicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is caused by a deficiency in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP regulates the translation of numerous mRNAs and its loss disturbs the composition of proteins important for dendritic spine and synapse development. Here we investigated whether the astrocyte-derived factors hevin and SPARC known to regulate excitatory synapse development have altered expression in FXS. Specifically we analyzed the expression of these factors in wild-type (WT) mice and in fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knock-out (KO) mice that lack FMRP expression. Samples were collected from the developing cortex and hippocampus (regions of dendritic spine abnormalities in FXS) of Fmr1 KO and WT pups. Hevin and SPARC showed altered expression patterns in Fmr1 KO mice compared to WT in a brain-region specific manner. In cortical tissue we found a transient increase in the level of hevin in postnatal day (P)14 Fmr1 KO mice compared to WT. Additionally there were modest decreases in Fmr1 KO cortical levels of SPARC at P7 and P14. In the hippocampus hevin expression was much lower in P7 Fmr1 KO mice than in WT. At P14 hippocampal hevin levels were similar between genotypes and by P21 Fmr1 KO hevin expression surpassed WT levels.

This is supported in part by the dysregulation of many chromatin-remodelling proteins in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. A key example is ATRX an X-linked gene commonly mutated in individuals with syndromic and nonsyndromic intellectual disability. The consequences of Atrx inactivation for learning and memory have been difficult to evaluate because of the early lethality of hemizygous-null animals. In this study we evaluated the outcome of brain-specific Atrx deletion in heterozygous female mice. These mice exhibit a mosaic pattern of ATRX protein expression in the central nervous system attributable to the location of the gene on the X chromosome. Although the hemizygous male mice die soon after birth heterozygous females survive to adulthood. Body growth is stunted in these animals and they have low circulating concentrations of insulin growth factor 1. In addition they are impaired in spatial contextual fear and novel object recognition memory.

Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) has been attributed a key role in the control of neuronal activity-dependent gene expression and is a master regulator of experience-dependent epigenetic programming. Moreover mutations in the MECP2 gene are the primary cause of Rett syndrome and to a lesser extent of a range of other major neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we aim to study the interaction of MeCP2 with early-life stress in variables known to be affected by this environmental manipulation namely anxiety-like behavior and activity of the underlying neural circuits. METHODS: Using Mecp2 heterozygous and wild-type female mice we investigated the effects of the interaction of Mecp2 haplodeficiency with maternal separation later in life by assessing anxiety-related behaviors and measuring concomitant c-FOS expression in stress- and anxiety-related brain regions of adolescent females. Moreover arginine vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus were analyzed for neuronal activation. RESULTS: In wild-type mice maternal separation caused a reduction in anxiety-like behavior and in the activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus specifically in corticotropin-releasing hormone-positive cells after the elevated plus maze. This effect of maternal separation was not observed in Mecp2 heterozygous females that per se show decreased anxiety-like behavior and concomitant decreased paraventricular nuclei activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data supports that MeCP2 is an essential component of HPA axis reprogramming and underlies the differential response to anxiogenic situations later in life.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121343382&doi=10.1186%2fs11689-021-09409-7&partnerID=40&md5=28945e9b0ac82d3ac2b0873a7f1cdbd8","Unitat Mixta d'Investigació en Neuroanatomia Funcional Departamento de Biologia Cel·lular Biologia Funcional i Antropologia Física Universitat de València 46100 Burjassot València Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Genetics and Molecular Neurobiology Institute of Biology Otto-von-Guericke University 39120 Magdeburg Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology University of Coimbra 3004-504 Coimbra Portugal. mjpsantos@cnc.uc.pt.",2021,"10.1186/s11689-021-09409-7","Article","*Adverse Childhood ExperiencesAnimalsAnxiety/etiologyFemaleHumans*Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolismMaternal Deprivation*Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/genetics/metabolismMicePituitary-Adrenal System/metabolismArginine-vasopressinCorticotropin-releasing hormoneMaternal separationRett syndromec-FOS","pubmed-34895132.pdf","pubmed-34895132","xml_texts/PMC8903671.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs11689-021-09409-7.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs11689-021-09409-7.pdf"

The loss of motor function is an important clinical feature of RTT that manifests early during the course of the disease. RTT mouse models with mutations in the murine orthologous Mecp2 gene replicate many human phenotypes including progressive motor impairments. However relatively little is known about the changes in circuit function during the progression of motor deficit in this model. As the motor cortex is the key node in the motor system for the control of voluntary movement we measured firing activity in populations of motor cortical neurons during locomotion on a motorized wheel-treadmill. Different populations of neurons intermingled in the motor cortex signal different aspects of the locomotor state of the animal. The proportion of running selective neurons whose activity positively correlates with locomotion speed gradually decreases with weekly training in wild-type mice but not in Mecp2-null mice. The fraction of rest-selective neurons whose activity negatively correlates with locomotion speed does not change with training in wild-type mice but is higher and increases with the progression of locomotion deficit in mutant mice. The synchronization of population activity that occurs in WT mice with training did not occur in Mecp2-null mice a phenotype most clear during locomotion and observable across all functional cell types.

Given the recent discovery of readthrough enhancers, CDX compounds, we herein evaluated the potentiation effect of CDX5-1, CDX5-288, and CDX6-180 on gentamicin-mediated readthrough efficiency in transfected HeLa cell lines bearing the four most common  MECP2  nonsense mutations. We showed that all three CDX compounds potentiated gentamicin-mediated readthrough and increased full-length MeCP2 protein levels in cells expressing the R168X, R255X, R270X, and R294X nonsense mutations. Among all three CDX compounds, CDX5-288 was the most potent enhancer and enabled the use of reduced doses of gentamicin, thus mitigating the toxicity. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated the upregulation of full-length Mecp2 protein expression in fibroblasts derived from  Mecp2 R255X/Y  mice through combinatorial treatment.

In neurons the paternal allele of UBE3A is intact but epigenetically silenced raising the possibility that Angelman syndrome could be treated by activating this silenced allele to restore functional UBE3A protein. Using an unbiased high-content screen in primary cortical neurons from mice we identify twelve topoisomerase I inhibitors and four topoisomerase II inhibitors that unsilence the paternal Ube3a allele. These drugs included topotecan irinotecan etoposide and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). At nanomolar concentrations topotecan upregulated catalytically active UBE3A in neurons from maternal Ube3a-null mice. Topotecan concomitantly downregulated expression of the Ube3a antisense transcript that overlaps the paternal copy of Ube3a. These results indicate that topotecan unsilences Ube3a in cis by reducing transcription of an imprinted antisense RNA. When administered in vivo topotecan unsilenced the paternal Ube3a allele in several regions of the nervous system including neurons in the hippocampus neocortex striatum cerebellum and spinal cord. Paternal expression of Ube3a remained elevated in a subset of spinal cord neurons for at least 12  weeks after cessation of topotecan treatment indicating that transient topoisomerase inhibition can have enduring effects on gene expression.

FOXP1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ASD language deficits global developmental delay and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Strongly reduced Foxp1 expression has been detected in the hippocampus of Foxp1(+/-) mice a brain region required for learning and memory. To investigate learning and memory performance in these animals fear conditioning tests were carried out which showed impaired associative learning compared with wild type (WT) animals. To shed light on the underlying mechanism we analyzed various components of the mitochondrial network in the hippocampus. Several proteins regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g. Foxo1 Pgc-1α Tfam) and dynamics (Mfn1 Opa1 Drp1 and Fis1) were significantly dysregulated which may explain the increased mitophagy observed in the Foxp1(+/-) hippocampus. The reduced activity of complex I and decreased expression of Sod2 most likely increase the production of reactive oxygen species and the expression of the pre-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax in this tissue. In conclusion we provide evidence that a disrupted mitochondrial network and the resulting oxidative stress in the hippocampus contribute to the altered learning and cognitive impairment in Foxp1(+/-) mice suggesting that similar alterations also play a major role in patients with FOXP1 syndrome.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123016768&doi=10.3390%2fgenes13010127&partnerID=40&md5=94f40c03897989add76d209958223cb5","Department of Human Molecular Genetics Institute of Human Genetics Heidelberg University Hospital Im Neuenheimer Feld 366 69120 Heidelberg Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rInterdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences Im Neuenheimer Feld 366 69120 Heidelberg Germany.",2022,"10.3390/genes13010127","Article","Animals*Disease Models AnimalForkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology*HaploinsufficiencyHippocampus/metabolism/pathologyLearning/*physiologyMemory Disorders/etiology/metabolism/*pathologyMiceMice Inbred C57BLMice KnockoutMitochondria/genetics/metabolism/*pathology*MitophagyRepressor Proteins/*physiologyFOXP1 syndromeFoxp1+/− mouseassociative learningautism spectrum disorderhippocampusmitochondrial dysfunctionreactive oxygen species","pubmed-35052467.pdf","pubmed-35052467","xml_texts/PMC8775322.xml","full_texts/10.3390%2Fgenes13010127.txt","full_texts/10.3390%2Fgenes13010127.pdf"

This study investigated the developmental aspect of autism-related behaviors and other phenotypes in a  Shank3 -transgenic mouse model. The animals underwent two sets of identical behavioral experiments, spanning motor skills, social and repetitive behavior, and cognition: baseline began at 5 weeks of age, corresponding to human adolescence, and the follow-up was initiated when aged 13 weeks, resembling early adulthood in humans. Interestingly, the animals displayed relatively stable phenotypes. Moreover, motor coordination and endurance were impaired, while muscle strength was unchanged. Surprisingly, the animals displayed only minor impairments in social behavior, but pronounced stereotypic and repetitive behaviors. Some behavioral tests indicated increased avoidance and anxiety. While spatial learning and memory were unchanged, knockout animals displayed slightly impaired cognitive flexibility. Female animals had similar abnormalities as males in the paradigms testing avoidance, anxiety, and cognition, but were less pathological in motor function and repetitive behavior. In all test paradigms, heterozygous  Shank3  knockout animals had either no abnormal or a milder phenotype.

"Deficits in integrative NMDA receptors caused by Grin1 disruption can be rescued in adulthood.","Venkatesan, S; Binko, MA; Mielnik, CA; Ramsey, AJ; Lambe, EK","Neuropsychopharmacology",NA,"Glutamatergic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are critical for cognitive function, and their reduced expression leads to intellectual disability. Since subpopulations of NMDARs exist in distinct subcellular environments, their functioning may be unevenly vulnerable to genetic disruption. Here, we investigate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs on the major output neurons of the prefrontal cortex in mice deficient for the obligate NMDAR subunit encoded by Grin1 and wild-type littermates. With whole-cell recording in brain slices, we find that single, low-intensity stimuli elicit surprisingly-similar glutamatergic synaptic currents in both genotypes. By contrast, clear genotype differences emerge with manipulations that recruit extrasynaptic NMDARs, including stronger, repetitive, or pharmacological stimulation. These results reveal a disproportionate functional deficit of extrasynaptic NMDARs compared to their synaptic counterparts. To probe the repercussions of this deficit, we examine an NMDAR-dependent phenomenon considered a building block of cognitive integration, basal dendrite plateau potentials. Since we find this phenomenon is readily evoked in wild-type but not in Grin1-deficient mice, we ask whether plateau potentials can be restored by an adult intervention to increase Grin1 expression. This genetic manipulation, previously shown to restore cognitive performance in adulthood, successfully rescues electrically-evoked basal dendrite plateau potentials after a lifetime of NMDAR compromise. Taken together, our work demonstrates NMDAR subpopulations are not uniformly vulnerable to the genetic disruption of their obligate subunit. Furthermore, the window for functional rescue of the more-sensitive integrative NMDARs remains open into adulthood.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37349472",NA,2023,"10.1038/s41386-023-01619-y","Article",NA,"pubmed-37349472.pdf","pubmed-37349472","xml_texts/PMC10579298.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41386-023-01619-y.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41386-023-01619-y.pdf"

"Loss of nuclear UBE3A activity is the predominant cause of Angelman syndrome in individuals carrying UBE3A missense mutations","Bossuyt S. N. V.Punt A. M.de Graaf I. J.van den Burg J.Williams M. G.Heussler H.Elgersma Y.Distel B.","Hum Mol Genet",NA,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletion (~75%) or mutation (~10%) of the ubiquitin E3 ligase A (UBE3A) gene which encodes a HECT type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. Although the critical substrates of UBE3A are unknown previous studies have suggested a critical role of nuclear UBE3A in AS pathophysiology. Here we investigated to what extent UBE3A missense mutations disrupt UBE3A subcellular localization as well as catalytic activity stability and protein folding. Our functional screen of 31 UBE3A missense mutants revealed that UBE3A mislocalization is the predominant cause of UBE3A dysfunction accounting for 55% of the UBE3A mutations tested. The second major cause (29%) is a loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity as assessed in an Escherichia coli in vivo ubiquitination assay. Mutations affecting catalytic activity are found not only in the catalytic HECT domain but also in the N-terminal half of UBE3A suggesting an important contribution of this N-terminal region to its catalytic potential. Together our results show that loss of nuclear UBE3A E3 ligase activity is the predominant cause of UBE3A-linked AS. Moreover our functional analysis screen allows rapid assessment of the pathogenicity of novel UBE3A missense variants which will be of particular importance when treatments for AS become available.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106143770&doi=10.1093%2fhmg%2fddab050&partnerID=40&md5=416153f84679b9a2eb9964af0bc4c24b","Department of Medical Biochemistry Amsterdam UMC University of Amsterdam 1105 AZ Amsterdam The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Clinical Genetics and Department of Neuroscience Erasmus MC 3015 GD Rotterdam The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rENCORE Expertise Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Erasmus MC 3015 3015 CN Rotterdam The Netherlands.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rMater Research Institute Faculty of Medicine The University of Queensland 4101 South Brisbane Queensland Australia.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rChild Development Program Queensland Children's Hospital 4101 South Brisbane Queensland Australia.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rChild Health Research Centre The University of Queensland 4101 South Brisbane Queensland Australia.",2021,"10.1093/hmg/ddab050","Article","Angelman Syndrome/genetics/*pathologyAnimalsCell Nucleus/*metabolismEscherichia coli/metabolismHEK293 CellsHumansMice*Mutation MissenseNeurons/*metabolismSaccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolismUbiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism*Ubiquitination","pubmed-33607653.pdf","pubmed-33607653","xml_texts/PMC8101352.xml","full_texts/10.1093%2Fhmg%2Fddab050.txt","full_texts/10.1093%2Fhmg%2Fddab050.pdf"

To investigate the role of Ca(v)3.2 in global gene expression, we performed a microarray transcriptome study on the hippocampi of the Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates, either naive (untrained) or trace fear conditioned. We found a significant left-right asymmetric effect on the hippocampal transcriptome caused by the Ca(v)3.2 knockout. Between the naive Ca(v)3.2(-/-) and the naive wild-type mice, 3522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the left hippocampus, but only 4 DEGs were found in the right hippocampus. Remarkably, the effect of Ca(v)3.2 knockout was partially reversed by trace fear conditioning. The number of DEGs in the left hippocampus was reduced to 6 in the Ca(v)3.2 knockout mice after trace fear conditioning, compared with the wild-type naive mice.

"Autism-Risk Gene necab2 Regulates Psychomotor and Social Behavior as a Neuronal Modulator of mGluR1 Signaling","Chen Z.Long H.Guo J.Wang Y.He K.Tao C.Li X.Jiang K.Guo S.Pi Y.","Front Mol Neurosci",NA,"BACKGROUND: De novo deletion of the neuronal calcium-binding protein 2 (NECAB2) locus is associated with idiopathic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The in vivo function of NECAB2 in the brain remains largely elusive. METHODS: We investigated the morphological and behavioral profiles of both necab2 knock-out and overexpression zebrafish models. The expression pattern and molecular role of necab2 were probed through a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: We show that Necab2 is a neuronal specific cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein abundantly expressed in the telencephalon habenula and cerebellum. Necab2 is distributed peri-synaptically in subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. CRISPR/Cas9-generated necab2 knock-out zebrafish display normal morphology but exhibit a decrease in locomotor activity and thigmotaxis with impaired social interaction only in males. Conversely necab2 overexpression yields behavioral phenotypes opposite to the loss-of-function. Proteomic profiling uncovers a role of Necab2 in modulating signal transduction of G-protein coupled receptors. Specifically co-immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence and confocal live-cell imaging suggest a complex containing NECAB2 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1). In vivo measurement of phosphatidylinositol 45-bisphosphate further substantiates that Necab2 promotes mGluR1 signaling.

Disease modeling using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be a powerful tool to reproduce this syndrome's human pathology. However, no such effort has been reported to date. We here report a cellular model for DS that utilizes patient-derived iPSCs. Results: We generated iPSCs from a Dravet syndrome patient with a c.4933C&gt;T substitution in SCN1A, which is predicted to result in truncation in the fourth homologous domain of the protein (p.R1645*). Neurons derived from these iPSCs were primarily GABAergic (&gt;50%), although glutamatergic neurons were observed as a minor population (&lt;1%). Current-clamp analyses revealed significant impairment in action potential generation when strong depolarizing currents were injected. Conclusions: Our results indicate a functional decline in Dravet neurons, especially in the GABAergic subtype, which supports previous findings in murine disease models, where loss-of-function in GABAergic inhibition appears to be a main driver in epileptogenesis.

Identification of CDKL5 substrates is key to understanding its function. Using chemical genetics we found that CDKL5 phosphorylates three microtubule-associated proteins: MAP1S EB2 and ARHGEF2 and determined the phosphorylation sites. Substrate phosphorylations are greatly reduced in CDKL5 knockout mice verifying these as physiological substrates. In CDKL5 knockout mouse neurons dendritic microtubules have longer EB3-labelled plus-end growth duration and these altered dynamics are rescued by reduction of MAP1S levels through shRNA expression indicating that CDKL5 regulates microtubule dynamics via phosphorylation of MAP1S. We show that phosphorylation by CDKL5 is required for MAP1S dissociation from microtubules. Additionally anterograde cargo trafficking is compromised in CDKL5 knockout mouse dendrites. Finally EB2 phosphorylation is reduced in patient-derived human neurons.

P.Wahlestedt C.","Plos one",NA,"Several genome-wide transcriptomics efforts have shown that a large percentage of the mammalian genome is transcribed into RNAs however only a small percentage (1-2%) of these RNAs is translated into proteins. Currently there is an intense interest in characterizing the function of the different classes of noncoding RNAs and their relevance to human disease. Using genomic approaches we discovered FMR4 a primate-specific noncoding RNA transcript (2.4 kb) that resides upstream and likely shares a bidirectional promoter with FMR1. FMR4 is a product of RNA polymerase II and has a similar half-life to FMR1. The CGG expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 appears to affect transcription in both directions as we found FMR4 similar to FMR1 to be silenced in fragile X patients and up-regulated in premutation carriers. Knockdown of FMR4 by several siRNAs did not affect FMR1 expression nor vice versa suggesting that FMR4 is not a direct regulatory transcript for FMR1. However FMR4 markedly affected human cell proliferation in vitro; siRNAs knockdown of FMR4 resulted in alterations in the cell cycle and increased apoptosis while the overexpression of FMR4 caused an increase in cell proliferation. Collectively our results demonstrate an antiapoptotic function of FMR4 and provide evidence that a well-studied genomic locus can show unexpected functional complexity.

Mouse models of XLAG ISSX and other human ARX mutations demonstrate a direct genotype-phenotype correlation in ARX-related neurologic disorders. Furthermore mouse models utilizing a polyalanine tract expansion mutation have illustrated critical developmental differences between null mutations and expansion mutations in the brain revealing context-specific defects.

We show direct delivery of an OT receptor antagonist to the central nervous system did not rescue the attenuated contextual or cued fear memory responses in CD mice. Thus increased OT signaling is not acutely responsible for this phenotype. We also evaluated OT receptor and serotonin transporter availability in regions related to fear learning memory and sociability using autoradiography in wild type and CD mice. While no differences withstood correction we identified regions that may warrant further investigation. There was a nonsignificant decrease in OT receptor expression in the lateral septal nucleus and nonsignificant lowered serotonin transporter availability in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex.

The clinical application of next-generation sequencing for pediatric seizures and developmental delay of unknown causes has become common in studies aimed at identification of a causal gene in patients with ubiquitin-related rare diseases that cannot be diagnosed using conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization or chromosome microarray tests. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of ubiquitin-proteasome system on ultra-rare neurodevelopmental diseases, through functional identification of candidate genes and variants. In our present work, we carried out genome analysis of a patient with clinical phenotypes of developmental delay and intractable convulsion, to identify causal mutations. Further characterization of the candidate gene was performed using zebrafish, through gene knockdown approaches. Transcriptomic analysis using whole embryos of zebrafish knockdown morphants and additional functional studies identified downstream pathways of the candidate gene affecting neurogenesis. Through trio-based whole-genome sequencing analysis, we identified a de novo missense variant of the ubiquitin system-related gene UBE2H (c.449C>T; p.Thr150Met) in the proband. Using zebrafish, we found that Ube2h is required for normal brain development. Differential gene expression analysis revealed activation of the ATM-p53 signaling pathway in the absence of Ube2h. Moreover, depletion of ube2h led to induction of apoptosis, specifically in the differentiated neural cells. Finally, we found that a missense mutation in zebrafish, ube2h (c.449C>T; p.Thr150Met), which mimics a variant identified in a patient with neurodevelopmental defects, causes aberrant Ube2h function in zebrafish embryos. A de novo heterozygous variant in the UBE2H c.449C>T (p.Thr150Met) has been identified in a pediatric patient with global developmental delay and UBE2H is essential for normal neurogenesis in the brain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37208785","School of Life Sciences, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, 44919, South Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering, UNIST, Ulsan, 44919, South Korea; Korean Genomics Center, UNIST, Ulsan, 44919, South Korea; Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan, 44919, South Korea; Division of Medical Genetics and Metabolism Department of Paediatrics, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Children’s Hospital, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea; Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea; Clinical Research Institute, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, 05278, South Korea",2023,"10.1186/s40246-023-00491-7","Article","ATM; Brain; Rare disease; Transcriptomics; UBE2H; Zebrafish; p53","pubmed-37208785.pdf","pubmed-37208785","xml_texts/PMC10199504.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs40246-023-00491-7.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs40246-023-00491-7.pdf"

"Epileptic pilocarpine-treated rats exhibit aberrant hippocampal EPSP-spike potentiation but retain long-term potentiation","Carpenter-Hyland E.Bichler E. K.Smith M.Sloviter R. S.Benveniste M.","Physiol Rep",NA,"Hippocampal neuron plasticity is strongly associated with learning memory and cognition. In addition to modification of synaptic function and connectivity the capacity of hippocampal neurons to undergo plasticity involves the ability to change nonsynaptic excitability. This includes altering the probability that EPSPs will generate action potentials (E-S plasticity). Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder commonly associated with neuronal hyperexcitability and cognitive dysfunction. We examined E-S plasticity in chronically epileptic Sprague-Dawley rats 3-10 weeks after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices were assayed by whole-cell current clamp to measure EPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation. Using a weak spike-timing-dependent protocol to induce plasticity we found robust E-S potentiation in conjunction with weak long-term potentiation (LTP) in saline-treated rats. In pilocarpine-treated rats a similar degree of LTP was found but E-S potentiation was reduced. Additionally the degree of E-S potentiation was not correlated with the degree of LTP for either group suggesting that they independently contribute to neuronal plasticity. E-S potentiation also differed from LTP in that E-S plasticity could be induced solely from action potentials generated by postsynaptic current injection. The calcium chelating agent BAPTA in the intracellular solution blocked LTP and E-S potentiation revealing the calcium dependence of both processes. These findings suggest that LTP and E-S potentiation have overlapping but nonidentical mechanisms of inducing neuronal plasticity that may independently contribute to cognitive disruptions observed in the chronic epileptic state.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049926531&doi=10.14814%2fPHY2.13490&partnerID=40&md5=3f4c911afffe6889145ddc76c83ce583","Neuroscience Institute Morehouse School of Medicine Atlanta Georgia.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeuroscience Institute Morehouse School of Medicine Atlanta Georgia mbenveniste@msm.edu.",2017,"10.14814/phy2.13490","Article","Action Potentials/drug effectsAnimalsElectric Stimulation/methodsEpilepsy Temporal Lobe/chemically induced/pathology/*physiopathologyExcitatory Postsynaptic Potentials/*drug effects/physiologyHippocampus/*drug effects/pathology/physiopathologyLong-Term Potentiation/drug effects/physiologyMuscarinic Agonists/pharmacologyNeuronal Plasticity/drug effects/physiologyPilocarpine/*pharmacologyRats Sprague-DawleyStatus Epilepticus/chemically induced/pathology/*physiopathologyEpilepsyE‐S plasticitylong‐term potentiationspike‐timing‐dependent plasticity","pubmed-29138358.pdf","pubmed-29138358","xml_texts/PMC5688781.xml","full_texts/10.14814%2Fphy2.13490.txt","full_texts/10.14814%2Fphy2.13490.pdf"

J.","Sci Rep",NA,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by deficits in social communication and restricted and/or repetitive behaviours. While the precise pathophysiologies are unclear increasing evidence supports a role for dysregulated neuroinflammation in the brain with potential effects on synapse function. Here we studied characteristics of microglia and astrocytes in the Neuroligin-3 (NL3(R451C)) mouse model of autism since these cell types are involved in regulating both immune and synapse function. We observed increased microglial density in the dentate gyrus (DG) of NL3(R451C) mice without morphological differences. In contrast WT and NL3(R451C) mice had similar astrocyte density but astrocyte branch length the number of branch points as well as cell radius and area were reduced in the DG of NL3(R451C) mice. Because retraction of astrocytic processes has been linked to altered synaptic transmission and dendrite formation we assessed for regional changes in pre- and postsynaptic protein expression in the cortex striatum and cerebellum in NL3(R451C) mice. NL3(R451C) mice showed increased striatal postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) protein levels and decreased cortical expression of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25).

W.Kim K.Yang E.Kim H.Kim E.","Front Cell Neurosci",NA,"IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons.

R.Chiavegatto S.Haddad L. A.","BMC Neurosci",NA,"BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome the major cause of inherited intellectual disability among men is due to deficiency of the synaptic functional regulator FMR1 protein (FMRP) encoded by the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. FMR1 alternative splicing produces distinct transcripts that may consequently impact FMRP functional roles. In transcripts without exon 14 the translational reading frame is shifted. For deepening current knowledge of the differential expression of Fmr1 exon 14 along the rat nervous system development we conducted a descriptive study employing quantitative RT-PCR and BLAST of RNA-Seq datasets. RESULTS: We observed in the rat forebrain progressive decline of total Fmr1 mRNA from E11 to P112 albeit an elevation on P3; and exon-14 skipping in E17-E20 with downregulation of the resulting mRNA. We tested if the reduced detection of messages without exon 14 could be explained by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) vulnerability but knocking down UPF1 a major component of this pathway did not increase their quantities. Conversely it significantly decreased FMR1 mRNA having exon 13 joined with either exon 14 or exon 15 site A. CONCLUSIONS: The forebrain in the third embryonic week of the rat development is a period with significant skipping of Fmr1 exon 14. This alternative splicing event chronologically precedes a reduction of total Fmr1 mRNA suggesting that it may be part of combinatorial mechanisms downregulating the gene's expression in the late embryonic period. The decay of FMR1 mRNA without exon 14 should be mediated by a pathway different from NMD. Finally we provide evidence of FMR1 mRNA stabilization by UPF1 likely depending on FMRP.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130987340&doi=10.1186%2fs12868-022-00711-1&partnerID=40&md5=7f044db2f9c885fed3bcd4537c6aeba9","Department of Genetics and Evolutionary Biology Instituto de Biociências Universidade de São Paulo Rua do Matão 277 # 327 São Paulo SP 05508-090 Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biochemistry Instituto de Química Universidade de São Paulo São Paulo SP Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pathology Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de São Paulo São Paulo SP Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Biology Drexel University Philadelphia PA USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas Universidade de São Paulo São Paulo SP Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry Instituto de Psiquiatria Faculdade de Medicina Universidade de São Paulo São Paulo SP Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Genetics and Evolutionary Biology Instituto de Biociências Universidade de São Paulo Rua do Matão 277 # 327 São Paulo SP 05508-090 Brazil. haddadL@usp.br.",2022,"10.1186/s12868-022-00711-1","Article","*Alternative Splicing/geneticsAnimalsEmbryonic DevelopmentExons/genetics*Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/metabolism*Prosencephalon/embryologyRNA Helicases/genetics/metabolismRNA Messenger/metabolismRatsTrans-Activators/genetics/metabolismCerebellumFmr1ForebrainFragile X syndrome-alternative splicingNervous systemNonsense-mediated decay (NMD)Upf1","pubmed-35641906.pdf","pubmed-35641906","xml_texts/PMC9158170.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs12868-022-00711-1.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs12868-022-00711-1.pdf"

Mutations in KDM5C cause Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic, Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ, OMIM #300534) and are one of the most common causes of X-linked ID. KDM5C encodes a histone demethylase for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3), which are enriched in transcriptionally engaged promoter regions. KDM5C regulates gene transcription; however, it remains unknown whether removal of H3K4me is fully responsible for KDM5C-mediated gene regulation. Most mutations functionally tested to date result in reduced enzymatic activity of KDM5C, indicating loss of demethylase function as the primary mechanism underlying MRXSCJ. Here, we report a novel KDM5C mutation, R1115H, identified in an individual displaying MRXSCJ-like symptoms. The carrier mother’s cells exhibited a highly skewed X-inactivation pattern. The KDM5C-R1115H substitution does not have an impact on enzymatic activity nor protein stability. However, when overexpressed in post-mitotic neurons, KDM5CR1115H failed to fully suppress expression of target genes, while the mutant also affected expression of a distinct set of genes compared to KDM5C-wildtype. These results suggest that KDM5C may have non-enzymatic roles in gene regulation, and alteration of these roles contributes to MRXSCJ in this patient. © 2018 Vallianatos, Farrehi, Friez, Burmeister, Keegan and Iwase.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046891366&doi=10.3389%2ffnmol.2018.00104&partnerID=40&md5=555155c515c0f76b5d755d6ad9173cd4","Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Diagnostic Laboratory, Greenwood Genetic Center, Greenwood, SC, United States; Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Division of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States",2018,"10.3389/fnmol.2018.00104","Article","androgen receptor; cycloheximide; histone demethylase; membrane protein; zinc finger protein; animal tissue; Article; autism; cell culture; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; gene; gene control; gene locus; gene mutation; gene overexpression; gene regulatory network; genetic transduction; human; human cell; immunofluorescence microscopy; in vitro study; intellectual impairment; KDM5C gene; male; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; protein stability; R1115H gene; RNA sequence; Sanger sequencing; signal transduction; Western blotting; whole exome sequencing; X chromosome inactivation","scopus-85046891366.pdf","scopus-85046891366","xml_texts/PMC5893713.xml","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00104.txt","full_texts/10.3389%2Ffnmol.2018.00104.pdf"

A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months due to diminished expression with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18 months but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya ENK-immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly SP-immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons.

Arhgef6 is the X-linked intellectual disability gene also known as XLID46 and clinical features of patients carrying Arhgef6 mutations include intellectual disability and in some cases sensorineural hearing loss. Rho GTPases act as molecular switches in many cellular processes. Their activities are regulated by binding or hydrolysis of GTP which is facilitated by GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins respectively. RAC1 and CDC42 have been shown to play important roles in hair cell (HC) stereocilia development. However the role of ARHGEF6 in inner ear development and hearing function has not yet been investigated. Here we found that ARHGEF6 is expressed in mouse cochlear HCs including the HC stereocilia. We established Arhgef6 knockdown mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR-Cas9) genome editing technique. We showed that ARHGEF6 was indispensable for the maintenance of outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia and loss of ARHGEF6 in mice caused HC stereocilia deficits that eventually led to progressive HC loss and hearing loss. However the loss of ARHGEF6 did not affect the synapse density and did not affect the mechanoelectrical transduction currents in OHCs at postnatal day 3.

Small molecule BET inhibitors are in clinical trials, yet almost nothing is known about Brd4 function in the brain. Here we show that Brd4 mediates the transcriptional regulation underlying learning and memory.

Conversely physical exercise has been shown to enhance cognitive performance emotional state and increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the current experiments we used two different voluntary running paradigms to examine how exercise impacts adult neurogenesis in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of Fmr1 KO mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that short-term (7 day) voluntary running enhanced cell proliferation in both wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. In contrast long-term (28 day) running only enhanced cell proliferation in the whole DG of WT mice but not in Fmr1 KO mice. Interestingly cell survival was enhanced in both WT and Fmr1 KO mice following exercise. Interestingly we found that running promoted cell proliferation and survival in the ventral DG of WTs but promoted cell survival in the dorsal DG of Fmr1 KOs. Our data indicate that long-term exercise has differential effects on adult neurogenesis in ventral and dorsal hippocampi in Fmr1 KO mice.

Dystrophin is expressed not only in muscles but also in central inhibitory synapses in the cerebellum hippocampus amygdala and cerebral cortex where it contributes to the organization of autism-associated trans-synaptic neurexin-neuroligin complexes and to the clustering of synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors. While brain defects due to dystrophin loss are associated with deficits in cognitive and executive functions communication skills and social behavior only a subpopulation of DMD patients meet the criteria for autism suggesting that mutations in the dystrophin gene may confer a vulnerability to autism. The loss of dystrophin in the mdx mouse model of DMD has been associated with cognitive and emotional alterations but social behavior and communication abilities have never been studied in this model. METHODS: Here we carried out the first in-depth analysis of social behavior and ultrasonic communication in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice using a range of socially relevant paradigms involving various degrees of executive and cognitive demands from simple presentation of sexual olfactory stimuli to social choice situations and direct encounters with female and male mice of various genotypes. RESULTS: We identified context-specific alterations in social behavior and ultrasonic vocal communication in mdx mice during direct encounters in novel environments. Social behavior disturbances depended on intruders' genotype and behavior suggesting alterations in executive functions and adaptive behaviors and were associated with selective alterations of the development rate acoustic properties and use of the ultrasonic vocal repertoire. CONCLUSIONS: This first evidence that a mutation impeding expression of brain dystrophin affects social behavior and communication sheds new light on critical cognitive emotional and conative factors contributing to the development of autistic-like traits in this disease model.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945937009&doi=10.1186%2fs13229-015-0053-9&partnerID=40&md5=dcdea41bded467cfb9872b180ea43040","CNRS Neuroscience Paris Saclay Institute UMR 9197 Orsay 91405 France ; Univ Paris-Sud UMR 9197 Orsay 91405 France ; Present address: Department of Psychobiology Universidad Complutense de Madrid Ciudad Universitaria 28040 Madrid Spain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCNRS Neuroscience Paris Saclay Institute UMR 9197 Orsay 91405 France ; Univ Paris-Sud UMR 9197 Orsay 91405 France.",2015,"10.1186/s13229-015-0053-9","Article","AutismDystroglycanDystrophinDystrophinopathiesExecutive functionsMdx miceNeuroliginSocial behaviorUltrasonic vocalizations","pubmed-26527530.pdf","pubmed-26527530","xml_texts/PMC4627616.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-015-0053-9.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs13229-015-0053-9.pdf"
"Assessment of behavioral morphological and electrophysiological changes in prenatal and postnatal valproate induced rat models of autism spectrum disorder","Fereshetyan K.Chavushyan V.Danielyan M.Yenkoyan K.","Sci Rep",NA,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by core symptoms such as alterations of social communication and restrictive or repetitive behavior. The etiology and pathophysiology of disease is still unknown however there is a strong interaction between genetic and environmental factors. An intriguing point in autism research is identification the vulnerable time periods of brain development that lack compensatory homeostatic corrections. Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug with a pronounced teratogenic effect associated with a high risk of ASD and its administration to rats during the gestation is used for autism modeling. It has been hypothesized that valproate induced damage and functional alterations of autism target structures may occur and evolve during early postnatal life. Here we used prenatal and postnatal administrations of VPA to investigate the main behavioral features which are associated with autism spectrum disorders core symptoms were tested in early juvenile and adult rats. Neuroanatomical lesion of autism target structures and electrophysiological studies in specific neural circuits. Our results showed that prenatal and early postnatal administration of valproate led to the behavioral alterations that were similar to ASD. Postnatally treated group showed tendency to normalize in adulthood. We found pronounced structural changes in the brain target regions of prenatally VPA-treated groups and an absence of abnormalities in postnatally VPA-treated groups which confirmed the different severity of VPA across different stages of brain development. The results of this study clearly show time dependent effect of VPA on neurodevelopment which might be explained by temporal differences of brain regions' development process. Presumably postnatal administration of valproate leads to the dysfunction of synaptic networks that is recovered during the lifespan due to the brain plasticity and compensatory ability of circuit refinement. Therefore investigations of compensatory homeostatic mechanisms activated after VPA administration and directed to eliminate the defects in postnatal brain may elucidate strategies to improve the course of disease.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120878750&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-02994-6&partnerID=40&md5=e06faf6b76c92d809e11e66b6a064ad1","Neuroscience Laboratory Cobrain Center Yerevan State Medical University named after M.

"Rare variants of small effect size in neuronal excitability genes influence clinical outcome in Japanese cases of SCN1A truncation-positive Dravet syndrome","Hammer, MF; Ishii, A; Johnstone, L; Tchourbanov, A; Lau, B; Sprissler, R; Hallmark, B; Zhang, M; Zhou, J; Watkins, J; Hirose, S","PLOS ONE",NA,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is a rare, devastating form of childhood epilepsy that is often associated with mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, SCN1A. There is considerable variability in expressivity within families, as well as among individuals carrying the same primary mutation, suggesting that clinical outcome is modulated by variants at other genes. To identify modifier gene variants that contribute to clinical outcome, we sequenced the exomes of 22 individuals at both ends of a phenotype distribution (i. e., mild and severe cognitive condition). We controlled for variation associated with different mutation types by limiting inclusion to individuals with a de novo truncation mutation resulting in SCN1A haploinsufficiency. We performed tests aimed at identifying 1) single common variants that are enriched in either phenotypic group, 2) sets of common or rare variants aggregated in and around genes associated with clinical outcome, and 3) rare variants in 237 candidate genes associated with neuronal excitability. While our power to identify enrichment of a common variant in either phenotypic group is limited as a result of the rarity of mild phenotypes in individuals with SCN1A truncation variants, our top candidates did not map to functional regions of genes, or in genes that are known to be associated with neurological pathways. In contrast, we found a statistically-significant excess of rare variants predicted to be damaging and of small effect size in genes associated with neuronal excitability in severely affected individuals. A KCNQ2 variant previously associated with benign neonatal seizures is present in 3 of 12 individuals in the severe category. To compare our results with the healthy population, we performed a similar analysis on whole exome sequencing data from 70 Japanese individuals in the 1000 genomes project. Interestingly, the frequency of rare damaging variants in the same set of neuronal excitability genes in healthy individuals is nearly as high as in severely affected individuals. Rather than a single common gene/variant modifying clinical outcome in SCN1A-related epilepsies, our results point to the cumulative effect of rare variants with little to no measurable phenotypic effect (i.e., typical genetic background) unless present in combination with a disease-causing truncation mutation in SCN1A.",NA,NA,2017,"10.1371/journal.pone.0180485","Article",NA,"wos-000405464100067.pdf","wos-000405464100067","xml_texts/PMC5501540.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0180485.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0180485.pdf"

Several studies have shown abnormalities in the auditory brainstem in FXS; however the emergence of these auditory phenotypes during development has not been described. Here we investigated the development of phenotypes in FXS model [Fmr1 knockout (KO)] mice in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and lateral superior olive (LSO). We studied features of the brainstem known to be altered in FXS or Fmr1 KO mice including cell size and expression of markers for excitatory (VGLUT) and inhibitory (VGAT) synapses. We found that cell size was reduced in the nuclei with different time courses. VCN cell size is normal until after hearing onset while MNTB and LSO show decreases earlier. VGAT expression was elevated relative to VGLUT in the Fmr1 KO mouse MNTB by P6 before hearing onset. Because glial cells influence development and are altered in FXS we investigated their emergence in the developing Fmr1 KO brainstem. The number of microglia developed normally in all three nuclei in Fmr1 KO mice but we found elevated numbers of astrocytes in Fmr1 KO in VCN and LSO at P14. The results indicate that some phenotypes are evident before spontaneous or auditory activity while others emerge later and suggest that Fmr1 acts at multiple sites and time points in auditory system development.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039752983&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0264-17.2017&partnerID=40&md5=6676038c05b04c23521394d142774045","Department of Neurobiology and Behavior University of California Irvine CA 92697.",2017,"10.1523/eneuro.0264-17.2017","Article","AnimalsAstrocytes/metabolism/pathologyBrain Stem/*growth & development/metabolism/*pathologyDisease Models AnimalFemaleFragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/*metabolismFragile X Syndrome/*metabolism/*pathologyMaleMice KnockoutMicroglia/metabolism/pathologyPhenotypeSex CharacteristicsSynapses/metabolism/pathologyauditorybrainstemfragile xlateral superior olivemedial nucleus of the trapezoid bodyventral cochlear nucleus:","pubmed-29291238.pdf","pubmed-29291238","xml_texts/PMC5744645.xml","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0264-17.2017.txt","full_texts/10.1523%2Feneuro.0264-17.2017.pdf"

Although NEUROD1 is essential for inner ear neuronal development the different aspects of the temporal and spatial requirements of NEUROD1 for the inner ear and mainly for auditory neuron development are not fully understood. In this study using Foxg1(Cre) for the early elimination of Neurod1 in the mouse otocyst we showed that Neurod1 deletion results in a massive reduction of differentiating neurons in the otic ganglion at E10.5 and in the diminished vestibular and rudimental spiral ganglia at E13.5. Attenuated neuronal development was associated with reduced and disorganized sensory epithelia formation of ectopic hair cells and the shortened cochlea in the inner ear. Central projections of inner ear neurons with conditional Neurod1 deletion are reduced unsegregated disorganized and interconnecting the vestibular and auditory systems. In line with decreased afferent input from auditory neurons the volume of cochlear nuclei was reduced by 60% in Neurod1 mutant mice.

Adult homozygotes displayed smaller forebrain structures. Single-nucleus transcriptomics revealed that glutamatergic neurons were particularly affected, exhibiting dysregulated gene expression profiles, accompanied by aberrations in neuronal morphology and connectivity. Remarkably, homozygous mice performed well on challenging cognitive tasks. In contrast, while heterozygous mice did not exhibit clear anatomical or behavioral differences, they displayed dysregulation of neuronal genes and altered neuronal morphology that was strikingly different from homozygous phenotypes.

The exquisitely precise laminar organization of the cerebral cortex arises during embryonic development when neurons migrate successively from ventricular zones to coalesce into specific cortical layers. While radial glia act as guide rails for projection neuron migration pre-formed vascular networks provide support and guidance cues for GABAergic interneuron migration. This study provides novel conceptual and mechanistic insights into this paradigm of vascular-neuronal interactions revealing new mechanisms of GABA and its receptor-mediated signaling via embryonic forebrain endothelial cells. With the use of two new endothelial cell specific conditional mouse models of the GABA pathway (Gabrb3(ΔTie2-Cre) and Vgat(ΔTie2-Cre)) we show that partial or complete loss of GABA release from endothelial cells during embryogenesis results in vascular defects and impairs long-distance migration and positioning of cortical interneurons. The downstream effects of perturbed endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling are critical leading to lasting changes to cortical circuits and persistent behavioral deficits. Furthermore we illustrate new mechanisms of activation of GABA signaling in forebrain endothelial cells that promotes their migration angiogenesis and acquisition of blood-brain barrier properties. Our findings uncover and elucidate a novel endothelial GABA signaling pathway in the CNS that is distinct from the classical neuronal GABA signaling pathway and shed new light on the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorders epilepsy anxiety depression and schizophrenia.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041642840&doi=10.1038%2fcr.2017.135&partnerID=40&md5=986fa10f1a0f5399d10fa0dc9ada01ee","Department of Psychiatry Harvard Medical School Boston MA 02215 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rAngiogenesis and Brain Development Laboratory Division of Basic Neuroscience McLean Hospital 115 Mill Street Belmont MA 02478 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rOscar-Langendorff-Institute of Physiology Rostock University Medical Center Gertrudenstrasse 9 18057 Rostock Germany.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rProgram in Structural and Molecular Neuroscience McLean Hospital 115 Mill Street Belmont MA 02478 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rPersonal Peptides LLC Houston TX 77002 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rEdwin L.

Here we examined Fmr1-targeted transgenic rats (Fmr1-KO rats) as an alternative preclinical model of FXS. We characterized the EEG phenotypes of Fmr1-KO rats by measuring basal EEG power and auditory steady state response (ASSR) to click trains of stimuli at a frequency of 10-80 Hz. Fmr1-KO rats exhibited reduced basal alpha power and enhanced gamma power and these rats showed enhanced locomotor activity in novel environment. While ASSR clearly peaked at around 40 Hz both inter-trial coherence (ITC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) were significantly reduced at the gamma frequency band in Fmr1-KO rats. Fmr1-KO rats showed gamma power abnormalities and behavioral hyperactivity that were consistent with observations reported in mouse models and subjects with FXS.

Specific single variants (SNVs formerly single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the genes encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders by altering glutamate transmission. However these variants associated with cognition and mental activity have rarely been explored in healthy adolescents. In this study we screened for SNVs in the glutamatergic signaling pathway to identify genetic variants associated with cognitive ability. We found that SNVs in the subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors including GRIA1 GRIN1 GRIN2B GRIN2C GRIN3A GRIN3B and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMK2A) are associated with cognitive function. Plasma CaMK2A level was correlated positively with the cognitive ability of Taiwanese senior high school students. We demonstrated that elevating CaMK2A increased its autophosphorylation at T286 and increased the expression of its downstream targets including GluA1 and phosphor- GluA1 in vivo. Additionally methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) a downstream target of CaMK2A was found to activate the expression of CaMK2A suggesting that MeCP2 and CaMK2A can form a positive feedback loop.

We previously showed that the lack of Ube3a-mediated ubiquitination of the Ca(2+)-activated small conductance potassium channel SK2 contributes to impairment of synaptic plasticity and learning in AS mice. Synaptic SK2 levels are also regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates SK2 in its C-terminal domain facilitating its endocytosis. Here we report that PKA activation restores theta burst stimulation (TBS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices from AS mice by enhancing SK2 internalization. While TBS-induced SK2 endocytosis is facilitated by PKA activation SK2 recycling to synaptic membranes after TBS is inhibited by Ube3a. Molecular and cellular studies confirmed that phosphorylation of SK2 in the C-terminal domain increases its ubiquitination and endocytosis. Finally PKA activation increases SK2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in Ube3a-overexpressing mice. Our results indicate that although both Ube3a-mediated ubiquitination and PKA-induced phosphorylation reduce synaptic SK2 levels phosphorylation is mainly involved in TBS-induced endocytosis while ubiquitination predominantly inhibits SK2 recycling. Understanding the complex interactions between PKA and Ube3a in the regulation of SK2 synaptic levels might provide new platforms for developing treatments for AS and various forms of autism.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086563454&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-66790-4&partnerID=40&md5=31acc1d686b915633d8cba7641f29ebc","College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Western University of Health Sciences Pomona CA 91766 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rGraduate College of Biomedical Sciences Western University of Health Sciences Pomona CA 91766 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rKey Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine Ministry of Education Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038 China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCollege of Pharmacy Western University of Health Sciences Pomona CA 91766 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rCollege of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Western University of Health Sciences Pomona CA 91766 USA. xbi@westernu.edu.",2020,"10.1038/s41598-020-66790-4","Article","Amino Acid SequenceAngelman Syndrome/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathologyAnimalsCA1 Region Hippocampal/pathology/physiopathologyCOS CellsChlorocebus aethiopsCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolismEndocytosisHippocampus/*pathology/physiopathologyLong-Term PotentiationMiceModels MolecularMutation*Neuronal PlasticityPhosphorylationProtein DomainsProtein TransportSmall-Conductance Calcium-Activated PotassiumChannels/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismSynapses/*metabolismUbiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolismUbiquitination","pubmed-32555345.pdf","pubmed-32555345","xml_texts/PMC7299966.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-66790-4.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41598-020-66790-4.pdf"
"Neuronal hyperexcitability drives central and peripheral nervous system tumor progression in models of neurofibromatosis-1","Anastasaki C., Mo J., Chen J. K., Chatterjee J., Pan Y., Scheaffer S. M., Cobb O., Monje M., Le L. Q., Gutmann D. H.","Nat Commun",NA,"Neuronal activity is emerging as a driver of central and peripheral nervous system cancers. Here we examined neuronal physiology in mouse models of the tumor predisposition syndrome Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) with different propensities to develop nervous system cancers. We show that central and peripheral nervous system neurons from mice with tumor-causing Nf1 gene mutations exhibit hyperexcitability and increased secretion of activity-dependent tumor-promoting paracrine factors. We discovered a neurofibroma mitogen (COL1A2) produced by peripheral neurons in an activity-regulated manner which increases NF1-deficient Schwann cell proliferation establishing that neurofibromas are regulated by neuronal activity. In contrast mice with the Arg1809Cys Nf1 mutation found in NF1 patients lacking neurofibromas or optic gliomas do not exhibit neuronal hyperexcitability or develop these NF1-associated tumors. The hyperexcitability of tumor-prone Nf1-mutant neurons results from reduced NF1-regulated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel function such that neuronal excitability activity-regulated paracrine factor production and tumor progression are attenuated by HCN channel activation. Collectively these findings reveal that NF1 mutations act at the level of neurons to modify tumor predisposition by increasing neuronal excitability and activity-regulated paracrine factor production.",NA,NA,2022,"10.1038/s41467-022-30466-6","Article",NA,"pubmed-35589737.pdf","pubmed-35589737","xml_texts/PMC9120229.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-022-30466-6.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41467-022-30466-6.pdf"
"Abnormal expression of cerebrospinal fluid cation chloride cotransporters in patients with Rett syndrome","Duarte S. T.Armstrong J.Roche A.Ortez C.Pérez A.O'Callaghan Mdel M.Pereira A.Sanmartí F.Ormazábal A.Artuch R.Pineda M.García-Cazorla A.","Plos one",NA,"OBJECTIVE: Rett Syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused mainly by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. The relevance of MeCP2 for GABAergic function was previously documented in animal models. In these models animals show deficits in brain-derived neurotrophic factor which is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. Neuronal Cation Chloride Cotransporters (CCCs) play a key role in GABAergic neuronal maturation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor is implicated in the regulation of CCCs expression during development. Our aim was to analyse the expression of two relevant CCCs NKCC1 and KCC2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of Rett syndrome patients and compare it with a normal control group. METHODS: The presence of bumetanide sensitive NKCC1 and KCC2 was analysed in cerebrospinal fluid samples from a control pediatric population (1 day to 14 years of life) and from Rett syndrome patients (2 to 19 years of life) by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Both proteins were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and their levels are higher in the early postnatal period. However Rett syndrome patients showed significantly reduced levels of KCC2 and KCC2/NKCC1 ratio when compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced KCC2/NKCC1 ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid of Rett Syndrome patients suggests a disturbed process of GABAergic neuronal maturation and open up a new therapeutic perspective.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880446973&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0068851&partnerID=40&md5=d268e8c388c3279509d2caddfafa5b8b","Department of Neurology Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (HSJD) Barcelona Spain. sofia.duarte22@hotmail.com",2013,"10.1371/journal.pone.0068851","Article","AdolescentCase-Control StudiesChildChild PreschoolFemaleGene Expression RegulationHumansInfantInfant NewbornMaleRett Syndrome/*cerebrospinal fluid/geneticsSolute Carrier Family 12 Member 2/*cerebrospinal fluid/geneticsSymporters/*cerebrospinal fluid/geneticsYoung Adult","pubmed-23894354.pdf","pubmed-23894354","xml_texts/PMC3716803.xml","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0068851.txt","full_texts/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0068851.pdf"
"Degraded inferior colliculus responses to complex sounds in prenatally exposed VPA rats","Tamaoki Y.; Pasapula V.; Chandler C.; Borland M.S.; Olajubutu O.I.; Tharakan L.S.; Engineer C.T.","Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders",NA,"Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit altered sensory processing and deficits in language development. Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) increases the risk for ASD and impairs both receptive and expressive language. Like individuals with ASD, rodents prenatally exposed to VPA exhibit degraded auditory cortical processing and abnormal neural activity to sounds. Disrupted neuronal morphology has been documented in earlier processing areas of the auditory pathway in VPA-exposed rodents, but there are no studies documenting early auditory pathway physiology. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize inferior colliculus (IC) responses to different sounds in rats prenatally exposed to VPA compared to saline-exposed rats. Methods: In vivo extracellular multiunit recordings from the inferior colliculus were collected in response to tones, speech sounds, and noise burst trains. Results: Our results indicate that the overall response to speech sounds was degraded in VPA-exposed rats compared to saline-exposed controls, but responses to tones and noise burst trains were unaltered. Conclusions: These results are consistent with observations in individuals with autism that neural responses to complex sounds, like speech, are often altered, and lays the foundation for future studies of potential therapeutics to improve auditory processing in the VPA rat model of ASD.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38166599","The University of Texas at Dallas",2024,"10.1186/s11689-023-09514-9","Article","Auditory processing|Autism|Inferior colliculus|Valproic acid","scopus-85181237404.pdf","scopus-85181237404","xml_texts/PMC10759431.xml","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs11689-023-09514-9.txt","full_texts/10.1186%2Fs11689-023-09514-9.pdf"

K.Lopez-Santiago L. F.Bennett V.McInnis M. G.Isom L. L.Wang C.Zhang M.Jones K. S.Jenkins P. M.","Mol Psychiatry",NA,"GABAergic circuits are critical for the synchronization and higher order function of brain networks. Defects in this circuitry are linked to neuropsychiatric diseases including bipolar disorder schizophrenia and autism. Work in cultured neurons has shown that ankyrin-G plays a key role in the regulation of GABAergic synapses on the axon initial segment and somatodendritic domain of pyramidal neurons where it interacts directly with the GABA(A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) to stabilize cell surface GABA(A) receptors. Here we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a mutation that abolishes the ankyrin-G/GABARAP interaction (Ank3 W1989R) to understand how ankyrin-G and GABARAP regulate GABAergic circuitry in vivo. We found that Ank3 W1989R mice exhibit a striking reduction in forebrain GABAergic synapses resulting in pyramidal cell hyperexcitability and disruptions in network synchronization. In addition we identified changes in pyramidal cell dendritic spines and axon initial segments consistent with compensation for hyperexcitability. Finally we identified the ANK3 W1989R variant in a family with bipolar disorder suggesting a potential role of this variant in disease. Our results highlight the importance of ankyrin-G in regulating forebrain circuitry and provide novel insights into how ANK3 loss-of-function variants may contribute to human disease.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057591841&doi=10.1038%2fs41380-018-0308-x&partnerID=40&md5=6154c72a0e8b0d82b26c074467532977","Department of Pharmacology University of Michigan Medical School Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rNeuroscience Graduate Program University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDivision of Life Sciences State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Clear Water Bay Kowloon Hong Kong China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Cell Biology Duke University Medical Center Durham NC 27710 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartments of Biochemistry Neurobiology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Duke University Medical Center Durham NC 27710 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Neurology University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Molecular and Integrative Physiology University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rHefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale School of Life Sciences University of Science and Technology of China Hefei China.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Pharmacology University of Michigan Medical School Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA. pjenkins@umich.edu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rDepartment of Psychiatry University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA. pjenkins@umich.edu.",2020,"10.1038/s41380-018-0308-x","Article","AdultAgedAnimalsAnkyrins/genetics/*metabolismApoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolismBipolar Disorder/genetics/metabolismCells CulturedFemaleGABAergic Neurons/metabolismHumansMaleMiceMicrotubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolismMiddle Aged*Neural PathwaysProsencephalon/*cytology/*metabolismSynapses/metabolismYoung Adult","pubmed-30504823.pdf","pubmed-30504823","xml_texts/PMC6542726.xml","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-018-0308-x.txt","full_texts/10.1038%2Fs41380-018-0308-x.pdf"

Here we characterize mice with genetic deletion of Tbc1d7 which are viable with normal growth and development. Consistent with partial loss of function of the TSC complex Tbc1d7 knockout (KO) mice display variable increases in tissue mTORC1 signaling with increased muscle fiber size but with strength and motor defects. Their most pronounced phenotype is brain overgrowth due to thickening of the cerebral cortex with enhanced neuron-intrinsic mTORC1 signaling and growth.
