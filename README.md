# NDC-SOLES
NDC-SOLES uses a series of automated tools and machine-learning approaches to systematically collect, synthesise, and display experimental evidence in genetically-modified animal models of neurodevelopmental conditions.

## About SOLES
Systematic online living evidence summaries (SOLES) is a novel approach to research synthesis, using automated approaches and machine learning to keep to to date with new research as it is published.
